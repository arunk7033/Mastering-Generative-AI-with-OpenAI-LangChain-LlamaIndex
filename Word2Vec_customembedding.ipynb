              "'A Game Of Thrones \\nBook One of A Song of Ice and Fire \\nBy George R. R. Martin \\nPROLOGUE \\n\"We should start back,\" Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark around them. \"The wildlings are \\ndead.\" \\n\"Do the dead frighten you?\" Ser Waymar Royce asked with just the hint of a smile. \\nGared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. \\n\"Dead is dead,\" he said. \"We have no business with the dead.\" \\n\"Are they dead?\" Royce asked softly. \"What proof have we?\" \\n\"Will saw them,\" Gared said. \"If he says they are dead, that\\'s proof enough for me.\" \\nWill had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather \\nthan sooner. \"My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,\" he put in. \\n\"My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\" Royce replied. \"Never believe anything you hear at a woman\\'s \\ntit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.\" His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest. \\nPage 1\\n\\n\"We have a long ride before us,\" Gared pointed out. \"Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling.\" \\nSer Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. \"It does that every day about this time. Are you \\nunmanned by the dark, Gared?\" \\nWill could see the tightness around Gared\\'s mouth, the barely sup \\npressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the \\nNight\\'s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than \\nthat. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a \\nnervous tension that came perilous close to fear. \\nWill shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all \\nthe old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it \\nafterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the \\nsouthron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him. \\nUntil tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles \\nrise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from \\nthe Wall, hard on the track of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had \\ncome before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the \\ntrees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something \\ncold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride \\nhellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander. \\nEspecially not a commander like this one. \\nSer Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome \\nyouth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the \\nknight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black \\nwoolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of \\nblack wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night\\'s Watch for less than \\nhalf a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe \\nwas concerned. \\nHis cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. \"Bet he killed them all himself, \\nhe did,\" Gared told the barracks over wine, \"twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.\" They had \\nall shared the laugh. \\nIt is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop \\nhis garron. Gared must have felt the same. \\n\"Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,\" Gared said. \\n\"They\\'re dead. They shan\\'t trouble us no more. There\\'s hard riding before us. I don\\'t like this weather. If \\nit snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow\\'s the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice \\nstorm, my lord?\" \\nThe lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted \\nPage 2\\n\\nway he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt \\nhim when he looked like that. \"Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.\" \\nWill had been a hunter before he joined the Night\\'s Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders \\nhad caught him red-handed in the Mallisters\\' own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters\\' own bucks, and \\nit had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as \\nsilent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent. \\n\"The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,\" Will said. \"I got close as I \\ndared. There\\'s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to \\nagainst the rock. The snow\\'s pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but \\nthe firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.\" \\n\"Did you see any blood?\" \\n\"Well, no,\" Will admitted. \\n\"Did you see any weapons?\" \\n\"Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. \\nIt was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.\" \\n\"Did you make note of the position of the bodies?\" \\nWill shrugged. \"A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like.\" \\n\"Or sleeping,\" Royce suggested. \\n\"Fallen,\" Will insisted. \"There\\'s one woman up an ironwood, halfhid in the branches. A far-eyes.\" He \\nsmiled thinly. \"I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn\\'t moving neither.\" \\nDespite himself, he shivered. \\n\"You have a chill?\" Royce asked. \\n\"Some,\" Will muttered. \"The wind, m\\'lord.\" \\nThe young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves whispered past them, and \\nRoyce\\'s destrier moved restlessly. \"What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?\" Ser \\nWaymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak. \\n\"It was the cold,\" Gared said with iron certainty. \"I saw men freeze \\nlast winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and \\nhow the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you \\nquieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of \\nmulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it \\ngets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don\\'t have the strength to fight it. It\\'s easier \\njust to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don\\'t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and \\ndrowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it\\'s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.\" \\n\"Such eloquence, Gared,\" Ser Waymar observed. \"I never suspected you had it in you.\" \\nPage 3\\n\\n\"I\\'ve had the cold in me too, lordling.\" Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look \\nat the stumps where his ears had been. \"Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got \\noff light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.\" \\nSer Waymar shrugged. \"You ought dress more warmly, Gared.\" \\nGared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester \\nAemon had cut the ears away. \"We\\'ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.\" He pulled \\nup his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen. \\n\"If Gared said it was the cold . . .\" Will began. \\n\"Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?\" \\n\"Yes, m\\'lord.\" There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the \\nman driving at? \\n\"And how did you find the Wall?\" \\n\"Weeping,\" Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. \"They \\ncouldn\\'t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn\\'t cold enough.\" \\nRoyce nodded. \"Bright lad. We\\'ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now \\nand then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me \\nremind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.\" The knight\\'s smile was cocksure. \\n\"Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.\" \\nAnd then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey. \\nWill went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light \\nsnow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its \\ncrust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier \\nsnorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. \\nGared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode. \\nTwilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old bruise, then faded to \\nblack. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will was grateful for the light. \\n\"We can make a better pace than this, surely,\" Royce said when the moon was full risen. \\n\"Not with this horse,\" Will said. Fear had made him insolent. \"Perhaps my lord would care to take the \\nlead?\" \\nSer Waymar Royce did not deign to reply. \\nSomewhere off in the wood a wolf howled. \\nWill pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and dismounted. \\nPage 4\\n\\n\"Why are you stopping?\" Ser Waymar asked. \\n\"Best go the rest of the way on foot, m\\'lord. It\\'s just over that ridge.\" \\nRoyce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A cold wind whispered through \\nthe trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like something half-alive. \\n\"There\\'s something wrong here,\" Gared muttered. \\nThe young knight gave him a disdainful smile. \"Is there?\" \\n\"Can\\'t you feel it?\" Gared asked. \"Listen to the darkness.\" \\nWill could feel it. Four years in the Night\\'s Watch, and he had never been so afraid. What was it? \\n\"Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?\" When Gared did not \\nanswer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well \\naway from the other horses, and drew his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the \\nmoonlight ran down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made from the \\nlook of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger. \\n\"The trees press close here,\" Will warned. \"That sword will tangle you up, m1ord. Better a knife.\" \\n\"If I need instruction, I will ask for it,\" the young lord said. \"Gared, stay here. Guard the horses.\" \\nGared dismounted. \"We need a fire. I\\'ll see to it.\" \\n\"How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is the last thing we want.\" \\n\"There\\'s some enemies a fire will keep away,\" Gared said. \"Bears and direwolves and ... and other \\nthings . . .\" \\nSer Waymar\\'s mouth became a hard line. \"No fire.\" \\nGared\\'s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes as he stared at the knight. \\nFor a moment he was afraid the older man would go for his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip \\ndiscolored by sweat, its edge nicked from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the \\nlordling\\'s life if Gared pulled it from its scabbard. \\nFinally Gared looked down. \"No fire,\" he muttered, low under his breath. \\nRoyce took it for acquiescence and turned away. \"Lead on,\" he said to Will. \\nWill threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low ridge where he had found \\nhis vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, \\nslick footing, with rocks and hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, \\nhe heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling\\'s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and muttered curses as \\nreaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his splendid sable cloak. \\nThe great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had known it would be, its lowest \\nbranches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and \\nPage 5\\n\\nlooked down on the empty clearing below. \\nHis heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight shone down on the \\nclearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the great rock, the little half-frozen stream. \\nEverything was just as it had been a few hours ago. \\nThey were gone. All the bodies were gone. \\n\"Gods!\" he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar Royce gained the ridge. He \\nstood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, \\noutlined nobly against the stars for all to see. \\n\"Get down!\" Will whispered urgently. \"Something\\'s wrong.\" \\nRoyce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. \"Your dead men seem to have \\nmoved camp, Will.\" \\nWill\\'s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was not possible. His eyes \\nswept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped on the axe. A huge double-bladed \\nbattle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, untouched. A valuable weapon . . . \\n\"On your feet, Will,\" Ser Waymar commanded. \"There\\'s no one here. I won\\'t have you hiding under a \\nbush.\" \\nReluctantly, Will obeyed. \\nSer Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. \"I am not going back to Castle Black a failure on \\nmy first ranging. We will find these men.\" He glanced around. \"Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a \\nfire.\" \\nWill turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was moving. It cut right through him. \\nHe went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with \\nsap, and he was lost among the needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered \\na prayer to the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it between his \\nteeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his mouth gave him comfort. \\nDown below, the lordling called out suddenly, \"Who goes there?\" Will heard uncertainty in the challenge. \\nHe stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. \\nThe woods gave answer: the rustle of leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a distant hoot of a snow owl. \\nThe Others made no sound. \\nWill saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through the wood. He turned his \\nhead, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, \\nscratching at one another with wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the \\nwords seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a bird, a reflection \\non the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after all? \\n\"Will, where are you?\" Ser Waymar called up. \"Can you see anything?\" He was turning in a slow circle, \\nsuddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. \\nPage 6\\n\\n\"Answer me! Why is it so cold?\" \\nIt was cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed hard against the trunk of the \\nsentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his cheek. \\nA shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and \\nhard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was \\nwhite as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the \\ntrees. The patterns ran like moonlight on water with every step it took. \\nWill heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. \\n\"Come no farther,\" the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy\\'s. He threw the long sable cloak \\nback over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword in both hands. The wind had \\nstopped. It was very cold. \\nThe Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none that Will had ever seen. No \\nhuman metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of \\ncrystal so thin that it seemed almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the \\nthing, a ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper than any razor. \\nSer Waymar met him bravely. \"Dance with me then.\" He lifted his sword high over his head, defiant. His \\nhands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was \\na boy no longer, but a man of the Night\\'s Watch. \\nThe Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human eyes, a blue that burned like \\nice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, watched the moonlight running cold along the metal. \\nFor a heartbeat he dared to hope. \\nThey emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of them . . . four . . . five . . . Ser \\nWaymar may have felt the cold that came with them, but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had \\nto call out. It was his duty. And his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the \\nsilence. \\nThe pale sword came shivering through the air. \\nSer Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of metal on metal; only a high, \\nthin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a \\nthird, then fell back a step. Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again. \\nBehind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, faceless, silent, the shifting \\npatterns of their delicate armor making them all but invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to \\ninterfere. \\nAgain and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against the strange anguished \\nkeening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight. \\nHis blade was white with frost; the Other\\'s danced with pale blue light. \\nThen Royce\\'s parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the ringmail beneath his arm. The \\nyoung lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets \\nseemed red as fire where they touched the snow. Ser \\nPage 7\\n\\nWaymar\\'s fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came away soaked with red. \\nThe Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was like the cracking of ice on \\na winter lake, and the words were mocking. \\nSer Waymar Royce found his fury. \"For Robert!\" he shouted, and he came up snarling, lifting the \\nfrost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight \\nbehind it. The Other\\'s parry was almost lazy. \\nWhen the blades touched, the steel shattered. \\nA scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a hundred brittle pieces, the \\nshards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood \\nwelled between his fingers. \\nThe watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. Swords rose and fell, all in a \\ndeathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed \\nhis eyes. Far beneath him, he heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles. \\nWhen he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the ridge below was empty. \\nHe stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly across the black sky. \\nFinally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, he climbed down. \\nRoyce\\'s body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable cloak had been slashed in a \\ndozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young he was. A boy. \\nHe found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and twisted like a tree struck \\nby lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. \\nGared would know what to make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester \\nAemon. Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry. \\nWill rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him. \\nHis fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword transfixed the blind white pupil of \\nhis left eye. \\nThe right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw. \\nThe broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. Long, elegant hands brushed \\nhis cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with \\nblood, yet the touch was icy cold. \\nBRAN \\nThe morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the end of summer. They set \\nforth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with \\nexcitement. This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his \\nPage 8\\n\\nbrothers to see the king\\'s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran\\'s life. \\nThe man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword \\nsworn to Mance Rayder, the Kingbeyond-the-Wall. It made Bran\\'s skin prickle to think of it. He \\nremembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and \\nslayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and \\ndrank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible \\nhalf-human children. \\nBut the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king\\'s justice was old and \\nscrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in \\nblack, the same as a brother of the Night\\'s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy. \\nThe breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his lord father had the man cut \\ndown from the wall and \\ndragged before them. Robb and Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his \\npony, trying to seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he\\'d seen all this before. A faint wind blew \\nthrough the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of Winterfell: a grey direwolf \\nracing across an ice-white field. \\nBran\\'s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. His closely trimmed beard \\nwas shot with white, making him look older than his thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes \\nthis day, and he seemed not at all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of \\nthe age of heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father\\'s face, Bran thought, and \\ndonned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. \\nThere were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, but afterward Bran could \\nnot recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen \\ndragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down \\nonto the hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth \\nthe sword. \"Ice,\" that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man\\'s hand, and taller even than \\nRobb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian \\nsteel. \\nHis father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of his household guard. He \\ntook hold of Ice with both hands and said, \"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of \\nhis Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and \\nProtector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of \\nthe North, I do sentence you to die.\" He lifted the greatsword high above his head. \\nBran\\'s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. \"Keep the pony well in hand,\" he whispered. \"And \\ndon\\'t look away. Father will know if you do.\" \\nBran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away. \\nHis father took off the man\\'s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed out across the snow, as red \\nas surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be restrained to keep from bolting. Bran could not \\ntake his eyes off the blood. The snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched. \\nThe head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy\\'s feet. Theon was a lean, dark \\nPage 9\\n\\nyouth of nineteen who found \\neverything amusing. He laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. \\n\"Ass,\" Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on Bran\\'s shoulder, and Bran \\nlooked over at his bastard brother. \"You did well,\" Jon told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand \\nat justice. \\nIt seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died by then and the sun was \\nhigher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead of the main party, his pony struggling hard to \\nkeep up with their horses. \\n\"The deserter died bravely,\" Robb said. He was big and broad and growing every day, with his mother\\'s \\ncoloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes of the Tullys of Riverrun. \"He had courage, at the \\nleast.\" \\n\"No,\" Jon Snow said quietly. \"It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. You could see it in his \\neyes, Stark.\" Jon\\'s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed almost black, but there was little they did not \\nsee. He was of an age with Robb, but they did not look alike. Jon was slender where Robb was \\nmuscular, dark where Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast. \\nRobb was not impressed. \"The Others take his eyes,\" he swore. \"He died well. Race you to the bridge?\" \\n\"Done,\" Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and they galloped off down the \\ntrail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of \\nsnow as they went. \\nBran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the ragged man\\'s eyes, and he was \\nthinking of them now. After a while, the sound of Robb\\'s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent \\nagain. \\nSo deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride \\nbeside him. \"Are you well, Bran?\" he asked, not unkindly. \\n\"Yes, Father,\" Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, mounted on his great \\nwarhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. \"Robb says the man died bravely, but Jon says he \\nwas afraid.\" \\n\"What do you think?\" his father asked. \\nBran thought about it. \"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\" \\n\"That is the only time a man can be brave,\" his father told him. \"Do you understand why I did it?\" \\n\"He was a wildling,\" Bran said. \"They carry off women and sell them to the Others.\" \\nHis lord father smiled. \"Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, the man was an oathbreaker, \\na deserter from the Night\\'s Watch. No man is more dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he \\nis taken, so he will not flinch from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was \\nnot why the man had to die, but why I must do it.\" \\nPage 10\\n\\nBran had no answer for that. \"King Robert has a headsman,\" he said, uncertainly. \\n\"He does,\" his father admitted. \"As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet our way is the older way. \\nThe blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man \\nwho passes the sentence should swing the sword. If you would take a man\\'s life, you owe it to him to \\nlook into his eyes and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man does \\nnot deserve to die. \\n\"One day, Bran, you will be Robb\\'s bannerman, holding a keep of your own for your brother and your \\nking, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither \\nmust you look away. A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.\" \\nThat was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved and shouted down at \\nthem. \"Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!\" Then he was gone again. \\nJory rode up beside them. \"Trouble, my lord?\" \\n\"Beyond a doubt,\" his lord father said. \"Come, let us see what mischief my sons have rooted out now.\" \\nHe sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest came after. \\nThey found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted beside him. The late \\nsummer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so \\nthe sun shone in his hair. He was cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited \\nvoices. \\nThe riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid footing on the hidden, uneven \\nground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and \\njoking as he rode. Bran heard the breath go out of him. \"Gods!\" he exclaimed, struggling to keep control \\nof his horse as he reached for his sword. \\nJory\\'s sword was already out. \"Robb, get away from it!\" he called as his horse reared under him. \\nRobb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. \"She can\\'t hurt you,\" he said. \"She\\'s dead, \\nJory.\" \\nBran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, but his father made them \\ndismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran jumped off and ran. \\nBy then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. \"What in the seven hells is it?\" \\nGreyjoy was saying. \\n\"A wolf,\" Robb told him. \\n\"A freak,\" Greyjoy said. \"Look at the size of it.\" \\nBran\\'s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift to his brothers\\' side. \\nHalf-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice had formed in its shaggy \\ngrey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a woman\\'s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes \\ncrawling with maggots, a wide mouth full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It \\nwas bigger than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father\\'s kennel. \\nPage 11\\n\\n\"It\\'s no freak,\" Jon said calmly. \"That\\'s a direwolf. They grow larger than the other kind.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy said, \"There\\'s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years.\" \\n\"I see one now,\" Jon replied. \\nBran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb\\'s arms. He \\ngave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It \\nnuzzled blindly against Robb\\'s chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad \\nlittle whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. \"Go on,\" Robb told him. \"You can touch him.\" \\nBran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, \"Here you go.\" His half brother put a \\nsecond pup into his arms. \"There are five of them.\" Bran sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup \\nto his face. Its fur was soft and warm against his cheek. \\n\"Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,\" muttered Hullen, the master of horse. \"I like it not.\" \\n\"It is a sign,\" Jory said. \\nFather frowned. \"This is only a dead animal, Jory,\" he said. Yet he seemed troubled. Snow crunched \\nunder his boots as he moved around the body. \"Do we know what killed her?\" \\n\"There\\'s something in the throat,\" Robb told him, proud to have found the answer before his father even \\nasked. \"There, just under the jaw.,, \\nHis father knelt and groped under the beast\\'s head with his hand. \\nHe gave a yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all wet with \\nblood. \\nA sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler uneasily, and no one dared to \\nspeak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he did not understand. \\nHis father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. \"I\\'m surprised she lived long \\nenough to whelp,\" he said. His voice broke the spell. \\n\"Maybe she didn\\'t,\" Jory said. \"I\\'ve heard tales . . . maybe the bitch was already dead when the pups \\ncame.\" \\n\"Born with the dead,\" another man put in. \"Worse luck.\" \\n\"No matter,\" said Hullen. \"They be dead soon enough too.\" \\nBran gave a wordless cry of dismay. \\n\"The sooner the better,\" Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. \"Give the beast here, Bran.\" \\nThe little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. \"No!\" Bran cried out fiercely. \"It\\'s \\nmine.\" \\nPage 12\\n\\n\"Put away your sword, Greyjoy,\" Robb said. For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father, \\nlike the lord he would someday be. \"We will keep these pups.\" \\n\"You cannot do that, boy,\" said Harwin, who was Hullen\\'s son. \\n\"It be a mercy to kill them,\" Hullen said. \\nBran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed brow. \"Hullen speaks truly, \\nson. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and starvation.\" \\n\"No!\" He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not want to cry in front of his \\nfather. \\nRobb resisted stubbornly. \"Ser Rodrik\\'s red bitch whelped again last week,\" he said. \"It was a small \\nlitter, only two live pups. She\\'ll have milk enough.\" \\n\"She\\'ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.\" \\n\"Lord Stark,\" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with \\ndesperate hope. \"There are five pups,\" he told Father. \"Three male, two female.\" \\n\"What of it, Jon?\" \\n\"You have five trueborn children,\" Jon said. \"Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your \\nHouse. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.\" \\nBran saw his father\\'s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart \\nat that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right \\nonly because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, \\nincluded even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom \\ndecreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own. \\nTheir father understood as well. \"You want no pup for yourself, Jon?\" he asked softly. \\n\"The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,\" Jon pointed out. \"I am no Stark, Father.\" \\nTheir lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. \"I will nurse him myself, \\nFather,\" he promised. \"I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.\" \\n\"Me too!\" Bran echoed. \\nThe lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. \"Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not \\nhave you wasting the servants\\' time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is \\nthat understood?\" \\nBran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue. \\n\"You must train them as well,\" their father said. \"You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing \\nto do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize \\nthem, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip \\nPage 13\\n\\na man\\'s arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?\" \\n\"Yes, Father,\" Bran said. \\n\"Yes,\" Robb agreed. \\n\"The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.\" \\n\"They won\\'t die,\" Robb said. \"We won\\'t let them die.\" \\n\"Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It\\'s time we were back to Winterfell.\" \\nIt was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of \\nvictory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. \\nBran was wondering what to name him. \\nHalfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly. \\n\"What is it, Jon?\" their lord father asked. \\n\"Can\\'t you hear it?\" \\nBran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering \\nof his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else. \\n\"There,\" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him \\ndismount where the direwolf lay \\ndead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling. \\n\"He must have crawled away from the others,\" Jon said. \\n\"Or been driven away,\" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the \\nlitter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran \\nthought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind. \\n\"An albino,\" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. \"This one will die even faster than the others.\" \\nJon Snow gave his father\\'s ward a long, chilling look. \"I think not, Greyjoy,\" he said. \"This one belongs \\nto me.\" \\nCATELYN \\nCatelyn had never liked this godswood. \\nShe had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood \\nthere was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling \\nstreams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers. \\nPage 14\\n\\nThe gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old \\nforest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and \\ndecay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green \\nneedles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close \\ntogether while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath \\nthe soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no \\nnames. \\nBut she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a man\\'s life, afterward he \\nwould seek the quiet of the godswood. \\nCatelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of \\nRiverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had \\nnames, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. \\nWorship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices \\nraised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk \\nor read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. \\nFor her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of \\nthe First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, \\nfaceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest. \\nAt the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black \\nand cold. \"The heart tree,\" Ned called it. The weirwood\\'s bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, \\nlike a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features \\nlong and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those \\neyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were \\ntrue; they had watched the castle\\'s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the \\nforest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men \\nacross the narrow sea. \\nIn the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the \\nIsle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had \\nits godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face. \\nCatelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword \\nIce was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of \\nhumus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the \\nweirwood seemed to follow her as she came. \"Ned,\" she called softly. \\nHe lifted his head to look at her. \"Catelyn,\" he said. His voice was distant and formal. \"Where are the \\nchildren?\" \\nHe would always ask her that. \"In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups.\" She spread her \\ncloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes \\nwatching her, but she did her best to ignore them. \"Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and \\ngracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.\" \\n\"Is he afraid?\" Ned asked. \\nPage 15\\n\\n\"A little,\" she admitted. \"He is only three.\" \\nNed frowned. \"He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble \\nhouse had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, \\npromised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark \\nwords. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners; were. \\n\"The man died well, I\\'ll give him that,\" Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it \\nlightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. \"I was glad for Bran\\'s sake. \\nYou would have been proud of Bran.\" \\n\"I am always proud of Bran,\" Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the \\nrippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the \\nforging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been \\nforged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their \\nmetal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was \\nforged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in \\nthe North. \\n\"He was the fourth this year,\" Ned said grimly. \"The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear \\nin him so deep that my words could not reach him.\" He sighed. \"Ben writes that the strength of the \\nNight\\'s Watch is down below a thousand. It\\'s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as \\nwell.\" \\n\"Is it the wildlings?\" she asked. \\n\"Who else?\" Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. \"And it will only grow worse. The \\nday may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this \\nKingbeyond-the-Wall for good and all.\" \\n\"Beyond the Wall?\" The thought made Catelyn shudder. \\nNed saw the dread on her face. \"Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.\" \\n\"There are darker things beyond the Wall.\" She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and \\nred eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts. \\nHis smile was gentle. \"You listen to too many of Old Nan\\'s stories. The Others are as dead as the \\nchildren of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No \\nliving man has ever seen one.\" \\n\"Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,\" Catelyn reminded him. \\n\"I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,\" he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its \\nsheath. \"You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my \\nlady?\" \\nCatelyn took her husband\\'s hand. \"There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble \\nyou until you had cleansed yourself.\" There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. \"I am \\nPage 16\\n\\nso sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.\" \\nHis eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, \\nNed had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his \\nfellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys 11 Targaryen had demanded their heads, \\nthe Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had \\npledged to protect. \\nAnd one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood \\ntogether in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully. \\n\"Jon . . .\" he said. \"Is this news certain?\" \\n\"It was the king\\'s seal, and the letter is in Robert\\'s own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was \\ntaken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not \\nlinger long in pain.\" \\n\"That is some small mercy, I suppose,\" he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he \\nthought first of her. \"Your sister,\" he said. \"And Jon\\'s boy. What word of them?\" \\n\"The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,\" Catelyn said. \"I wish they \\nhad gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husband\\'s place, not hers. \\nLord Jon\\'s memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends \\naround her.\" \\n\"Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, I\\'d heard.\" \\nCatelyn nodded. \"Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still . . \\n.\" \\n\"Go to her,\" Ned urged. \"Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of \\nhers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.\" \\n\"Would that I could,\" Catelyn said. \"The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek \\nyou out.\" \\nIt took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the \\nunderstanding came, the darkness left his eyes. \"Robert is coming here?\" When she nodded, a smile \\nbroke across his face. \\nCatelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the \\nsnow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at \\nthis man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. \"I knew that would please you,\" she said. \"We \\nshould send word to your brother on the Wall.\" \\n\"Yes, of course,\" he agreed. \"Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest \\nbird.\" Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. \"Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no \\nmore notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?\" \\n\"I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. \\nPage 17\\n\\nCersei and the children travel with them.\" \\n\"Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,\" he said. \"It is just as well. That will give us more time to \\nprepare.\" \\n\"The queen\\'s brothers are also in the party,\" she told him. \\nNed grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen\\'s family, Catelyn knew. The \\nLannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert\\'s cause, when victory was all but certain, and he \\nhad never forgiven them. \"Well, if the price for Robert\\'s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. \\nIt sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.\" \\n\"Where the king goes, the realm follows,\" she said. \\n\"It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister woman\\'s teat the last \\ntime I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?\" \\n\"Prince Tornmen is seven,\" she told him. \"The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The \\nLannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.\" \\nNed squeezed her hand. \"There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I \\nshall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, \\nhow are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.\" \\nDAENERYS \\nHer brother held the gown up for her inspection. \"This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.\" \\nDany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could \\nnot remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. \"Is it really \\nmine?\" \\n\"A gift from the Magister Illyrio,\" Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. \"The \\ncolor will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio \\nhas promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.\" \\nA princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. \\n\"Why does he give us so much?\" she asked. \"What does he want from us?\" For nigh on half a year, they \\nhad lived in the magister\\'s house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old \\nenough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos. \\n\"Illyrio is no fool,\" Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his \\npale lilac eyes. \"The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.\" \\nDany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less \\nsavory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes \\nDothrak \\nand the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that he\\'d never had a friend he wouldn\\'t \\nPage 18\\n\\ncheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but \\nshe knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible \\nthing when roused. Viserys called it \"waking the dragon.\" \\nHer brother hung the gown beside the door. \"Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash \\noff the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of \\nmount.\" He studied her critically. \"You still slouch. Straighten yourself\" He pushed back her shoulders \\nwith his hands. \"Let them see that you have a woman\\'s shape now.\" His fingers brushed lightly over her \\nbudding breasts and tightened on a nipple. \"You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. \\nYou don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the \\nrough fabric of her tunic. \"Do you?\" he repeated. \\n\"No,\" Dany said meekly. \\nHer brother smiled. \"Good.\" He touched her hair, almost with affection. \"When they write the history of \\nmy reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.\" \\nWhen he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The \\nsquare brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the \\nsinging of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games \\nbeyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and \\nbreathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogo\\'s \\nmanse. \\nSomewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and \\ngreat rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and \\narmored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh \\nAndahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. \\nHer brother had a simpler name. \"Our land,\" he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he \\nsaid them enough, the gods were sure to hear. \"Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours \\nstill, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.\" \\nAnd perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother \\nsaid was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the \\nEyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. \\nViserys had been a boy of eight when they fled King\\'s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the \\nUsurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother\\'s womb. \\nYet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. \\nThe midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship\\'s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar \\nbattling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of \\nKing\\'s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper\\'s dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess \\nElia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar\\'s heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her \\neyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room \\nwhile the Kingslayer opened Father\\'s throat with a golden sword. \\nShe had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened \\nto rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while \\nit lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild \\nwaters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never \\nPage 19\\n\\nforgiven her. \\nShe did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurper\\'s brother set sail \\nwith his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of \\nthe Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been \\nprepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into \\nthe nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the \\nsafety of the Braavosian coast. \\nShe remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, halfblind, roaring and bellowing orders \\nfrom his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called \\nher \"Little Princess\" and sometimes \"My Lady,\" and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his \\nbed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That \\nwas when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a \\nlemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they \\nhad left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed \\nbehind them forever. \\nThey had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and \\nVolantis and Lys, never staying long in \\nany one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurper\\'s hired knives were close behind them, he \\ninsisted, though Dany had never seen one. \\nAt first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to \\ntheir homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, \\ndoors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, \\nand now even the coin they had gotten from Mother\\'s crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of \\nPentos, they called her brother \"the beggar king.\" Dany did not want to know what they called her. \\n\"We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,\" he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook \\nwhen he talked about it. \"The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and King\\'s Landing, the Iron Throne and \\nthe Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back.\" Viserys lived for that day. All \\nthat Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the \\nchildhood she had never known. \\nThere came a soft knock on her door. \"Come,\" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio\\'s \\nservants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister\\'s \\nmany Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. \\nThe old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was \\nIllyrio\\'s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked. \\nThey filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl \\npulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany\\'s head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, \\nbut Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother \\nhad often told her that it was never too \\nhot for a Targaryen. \"Ours is the house of the dragon,\" he would say. \"The fire is in our blood.\" \\nThe old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl \\nscrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. \"Drogo is so rich that even his slaves \\nPage 20\\n\\nwear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and \\nhis palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver.\" There was more like that, \\nso much more, what a handsome \\nman the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon \\narcher. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of \\nage. \\nFor centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his \\nsisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the \\nkingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the \\nbeasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys \\nschemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian. \\nWhen she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair \\nuntil it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the \\nDothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool \\non her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, \\nand then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals \\nonto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with \\namethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden tore emblazoned with ancient \\nValyrian glyphs. \\n\"Now you look all a princess,\" the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her \\nimage in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but \\nshe remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. \\nShe felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms. \\nHer brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in \\nthe water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. \"Stand there,\" he told her. \"Turn \\naround. Yes. Good. You look . . .\" \\n\"Regal,\" Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such \\na massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. \\nGemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real \\ngold. \"May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys,\" \\nthe magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow \\nteeth through the gold of his beard. \"She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision,\" he told her brother. \"Drogo \\nwill be enraptured.\" \\n\"She\\'s too skinny,\" Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly \\nbehind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, \\ngaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that \\nIllyrio had lent him, and said, \"Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?\" \\n\"She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, \" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. \"Look at \\nher. That silvergold hair, those purple eyes . . . she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt . . . \\nand highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.\" When \\nhe released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling. \\nPage 21\\n\\n\"I suppose,\" her brother said doubtfully. \"The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep . . .\" \\n\"Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,\" Illyrio said. \\nAnger flashed in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. \"Do you take me for a fool?\" \\nThe magister bowed slightly. \"I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My \\napologies if I have given offense.\" He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers. \\nThe streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio\\'s elaborately carved palanquin. Two \\nservants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a \\ndozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. \\nDany could smell the stench of Illyrio\\'s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes. \\nHer brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the \\nnarrow sea. \"We won\\'t need his whole khalasar, \" Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his \\nborrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. \"Ten thousand, that would be \\nenough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise \\nfor its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. \\nThe Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for \\ntheir king.\" He looked at Illyrio anxiously. \"They do, don\\'t they?\" \\n\"They are your people, and they love you well,\" Magister Illyrio said amiably. \"In holdfasts all across the \\nrealm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the \\nday of your return from across the water.\" He gave a massive shrug. \"Or so my agents tell me.\" \\nDany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but \\nshe mistrusted Illyrio\\'s sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding \\neagerly, however. \"I shall kill the Usurper myself,\" he promised, who \\nhad never killed anyone, \"as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what \\nhe did to my father.\" \\n\"That would be most fitting,\" Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint of a smile playing around \\nhis full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he pushed back a curtain and stared off into the \\nnight, and Dany knew he was fighting the Battle of the Trident once again. \\nThe nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat beside the waters of the bay, its high brick walls overgrown \\nwith pale ivy. It had been given to the khal by the magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities \\nwere always generous with the horselords. \"It is not that we fear these barbarians,\" Illyrio would explain \\nwith a smile. \"The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or so the red priests \\npromise . . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so cheap?\" \\nTheir palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by one of the house guards. \\nHe had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the \\nspiked bronze cap of the Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to \\nhim in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved them through the \\ngates. \\nDany noticed that her brother\\'s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of his borrowed sword. He \\nPage 22\\n\\nlooked almost as frightened as she felt. \"Insolent eunuch,\" Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up \\ntoward the manse. \\nMagister Illyrio\\'s words were honey. \"Many important men will be at the feast tonight. Such men have \\nenemies. The khal must protect his guests, yourself chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the \\nUsurper would pay well for your head.\" \\n\"Oh, yes,\" Viserys said darkly. \"He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His hired knives follow us \\neverywhere. I am the last dragon, and he will not sleep easy while I live.\" \\nThe palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a slave offered a hand to help \\nDaenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched \\nhard around his sword hilt. It took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet. \\nInside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon and cinnamon. \\nThey were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. \\nOil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls. Beneath \\nan arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. \"Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third \\nof his Name,\" he called in a high, sweet voice, \"King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, \\nLord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of \\nDragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.\" \\nThey stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight painted the \\nleaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, \\nbig men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and \\nbraided and hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and \\nTyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer \\nIsles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with a sudden \\nstart of fear, that she was the only woman there. \\nIllyrio whispered to them. \"Those three are Drogo\\'s bloodriders, there,\" he said. \"By the pillar is Khal \\nMoro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the \\nman behind him is Ser Jorah Mormont.\" \\nThe last name caught Daenerys. \"A knight?\" \\n\"No less.\" Illyrio smiled through his beard. \"Anointed with the seven oils by the High Septon himself.\" \\n\"What is he doing here?\" she blurted. \\n\"The Usurper wanted his head,\" Illyrio told them. \"Some trifling affront. He sold some poachers to a \\nTyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night\\'s Watch. Absurd law. A man should be able to do as \\nhe likes with his own chattel.\" \\n\"I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,\" her brother said. Dany found herself \\nlooking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past forty and balding, but still strong and fit. \\nInstead of silks and cottons, he wore wool and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the \\nlikeness of a black bear standing on two legs. \\nShe was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never known when Magister Illyrio \\nPage 23\\n\\nplaced a moist hand on her bare shoulder. \"Over there, sweet princess,\" he whispered, \"there is the khal \\nhimself.\" \\nDany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she displeased him she knew \\nshe would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to \\nwed her before the night was done. \\nThe slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head taller than the tallest man in \\nthe room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as the panther in Illyrio\\'s menagerie. He was younger \\nthan she\\'d thought, no more than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios \\nbound with gold and bronze rings. \\n\"I must go and make my submissions,\" Magister Illyrio said. \"Wait here. I shall bring him to you.\" \\nHer brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the khal, his fingers squeezing so hard that \\nthey hurt. \"Do you see his braid, sweet sister?\" \\nDrogo\\'s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with tiny bells that rang softly as \\nhe moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of \\nhis thighs. \\n\"You see how long it is?\" Viserys said. \"When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braids \\nin disgrace, so the world will know their shame. Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the \\nDragonlord come again, and you will be his queen.\" \\nDany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and dark as onyx. Her \\nbrother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he did not frighten her the way this man \\nfrightened her. \"I don\\'t want to be his queen,\" she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. \"Please, please, \\nViserys, I don\\'t want to, I want to go home.\" \\n\"Home?\" He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. \"How are we to go home, sweet \\nsister? They took our home from us!\" He drew her into the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into \\nher skin. \"How are we to go home?\" he repeated, meaning King\\'s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the \\nrealm they had lost. \\nDany had only meant their rooms in Illyrio\\'s estate, no true home surely, though all they had, but her \\nbrother did not want to hear that. There was no home there for him. Even the big house with the red door \\nhad not been home for him. His fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. \"I don\\'t know she \\nsaid at last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes. \\n\"I do,\" he said sharply. \"We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal Drogo\\'s army, that is how \\nwe go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for that, you will.\" He smiled at her. \"I\\'d let his whole \\nkhalasar fuck you if need be, sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it \\ntook to get my army. Be grateful it is \\nonly Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and \\nhe will not see you crying.\" \\nDany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, was escorting Khal Drogo \\nover to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen tears with the back of her hand. \\nPage 24\\n\\n\"Smile,\" Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his sword. \"And stand up straight. Let \\nhim see that you have breasts. Gods know, you have little enough as is.\" \\nDaenerys smiled, and stood up straight. \\nEDDARD \\nThe visitors poured through the castle gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred \\nstrong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen \\ngolden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of \\nBaratheon. \\nNed knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as bright as beaten gold, and \\nthere Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The tall boy beside him could only be the crown \\nprince, and that stunted little man behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister. \\nYet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the snow-white cloaks of the \\nKingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned . . . until he vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a \\nfamiliar roar, and crushed him in a bone-crunching hug. \"Ned! Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of \\nyours.\" The king looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. \"You have not changed at all.\" \\nWould that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they had ridden forth to win a \\nthrone, the Lord of Storm\\'s End had been clean-shaven, clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden\\'s fantasy. \\nSix and a half feet tall, he towered over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered \\nhelmet of his House, he became a veritable giant. He\\'d had a giant\\'s strength too, his weapon \\nof choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the smell of leather and \\nblood had clung to him like perfume. \\nNow it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to match his height. Ned had last \\nseen the king nine years before during Balon Greyjoy\\'s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had \\njoined to end the pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had \\nstood side by side in Greyjoy\\'s fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the rebel lord\\'s surrender \\nand Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the king had gained at least eight stone. A beard \\nas coarse and black as iron wire covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, \\nbut nothing could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. \\nYet Robert was Ned\\'s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, \"Your Grace. Winterfell is \\nyours.\" \\nBy then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their mounts. \\nRobert\\'s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her younger children. The wheelhouse in which \\nthey had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft \\nhorses, was too wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen\\'s ring, \\nwhile Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, \\nintroduced, and approved of by both sides. \\nNo sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his host, \"Take me \\ndown to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.\" \\nPage 25\\n\\nNed loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a lantern. No other \\nwords were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been riding since dawn, everyone was \\ntired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more \\nthan that; Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the arm, and she \\nhad said no more. \\nThey went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely recognized. The winding stone \\nsteps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. \"I was starting to think we would never reach \\nWinterfell,\" Robert complained as they descended. \"In the south, the way they talk about my Seven \\nKingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.\" \\n\"I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?\" \\nRobert snorted. \"Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent \\ninn north of the Neck. I\\'ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all yourpeople?\" \\n\"Likely they were too shy to come out,\" Ned jested. He could feel the chill coming up the stairs, a cold \\nbreath from deep within the earth. \"Kings are a rare sight in the north.\" \\nRobert snorted. \"More likely they were hiding under the snow. Snow, Ned!\" The king put one hand on \\nthe wall to steady himself as they descended. \\n\"Late summer snows are common enough,\" Ned said. \"I hope they did not trouble you. They are usually \\nmild.\" \\n\"The Others take your mild snows,\" Robert swore. \"What will this place be like in winter? I shudder to \\nthink.\" \\n\"The winters are hard,\" Ned admitted. \"But the Starks will endure. We always have.\" \\n\"You need to come south,\" Robert told him. \"You need a taste of summer before it flees. In Highgarden \\nthere are fields of golden roses that stretch away as far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they \\nexplode in your mouth-melons, peaches, fireplums, you\\'ve never tasted such sweetness. You\\'ll see, I \\nbrought you some. Even at Storm\\'s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you can \\nbarely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the markets bursting with \\nfood, the surnmerwines so cheap and so good that you can get drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is \\nfat and drunk and rich.\" He laughed and slapped his own ample stomach a thump. \"And the girls, Ned!\" \\nhe exclaimed, his eyes sparkling. \"I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in the \\nriver, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it\\'s too damn hot for wool or fur, so they go around in \\nthese short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if not, but it\\'s all the same when they start \\nsweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, they might as well be naked.\" The king laughed happily. \\nRobert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew how to take his \\npleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help \\nbut notice that those pleasures were taking a toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time \\nthey reached the bottom of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness \\nof the crypt. \\n\"Your Grace,\" Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide semicircle. Shadows moved and \\nPage 26\\n\\nlurched. Flickering light touched the stones underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite \\npillars that marched ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the \\npillars, the dead sat on their stone thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained \\ntheir mortal remains. \"She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.\" \\nHe led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering in the subterranean chill. It \\nwas always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they \\nwalked among the dead of House Stark. The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses \\nwere carved into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out into \\neternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The shifting shadows made the \\nstone figures seem to stir as the living passed by. \\nBy ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who had been Lord of \\nWinterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest had long ago rusted away to nothing, \\nleaving only a few red stains where the metal had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those \\nghosts were free to roam the castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard \\nas the land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had sworn \\nallegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North. \\nNed stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but \\nbeyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him \\nand his children. Ned did not like to think on that. \"Here,\" he told his king. \\nRobert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head. \\nThere were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned\\'s father, had a long, stern face. The \\nstonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, stone fingers holding tight to the sword across \\nhis lap, but in life all swords had failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children. \\nBrandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King Aerys Targaryen only a \\nfew short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him \\ndie. He was the true heir, the eldest, born to rule. \\nLyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned had loved her with all his \\nheart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have been his bride. \\n\"She was more beautiful than that,\" the king said after a silence. His eyes lingered on Lyanna\\'s face, as if \\nhe could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made awkward by his weight. \"Ah, damn it, Ned, did \\nyou have to bury her in a place like this?\" His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. \"She deserved \\nmore than darkness . . .\" \\n\"She was a Stark of Winterfell,\" Ned said quietly. \"This is her place.\" \\n\"She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and clouds above her and the rain to \\nwash her clean.\" \\n\"I was with her when she died,\" Ned reminded the king. \"She wanted to come home, to rest beside \\nBrandon and Father.\" He could hear her still at times. Promise me, she had cried, in a room that smelled \\nof blood and roses. Promise me, Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a \\nPage 27\\n\\nwhisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister\\'s eyes. Ned remembered the \\nway she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose \\npetals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. They had found him still \\nholding her body, silent with grief. The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. \\nNed could recall none of it. \"I bring her flowers when I can,\" he said. \"Lyanna was . . . fond of flowers.\" \\nThe king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as gently as if it were living flesh. \\n\"I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.\" \\n\"You did,\" Ned reminded him. \\n\"Only once,\" Robert said bitterly. \\nThey had come together at the ford of the Trident while the battle crashed around them, Robert with his \\nwarhammer and his great antlered helm, the Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate \\nwas the three-headed dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The \\nwaters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again and \\nagain, until at last a crushing blow from Robert\\'s hammer stove in the dragon and the chest beneath it. \\nWhen Ned had finally come on the scene, Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies \\nscrabbled in the swirling waters for rubies knocked free of his armor. \\n\"In my dreams, I kill him every night,\" Robert admitted. \"A thousand deaths will still be less than he \\ndeserves.\" \\nThere was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, \"We should return, Your Grace. Your \\nwife will be waiting.\" \\n\"The Others take my wife,\" Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the way they had come, his \\nfootsteps falling heavily. \"And if I hear \\'Your Grace\\' once more, I\\'ll have your head on a spike. We are \\nmore to each other than that.\" \\n\"I had not forgotten,\" Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he said, \"Tell me about Jon.\" \\nRobert shook his head. \"I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a tourney on my son\\'s \\nname day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he would live forever. A fortnight later he \\nwas dead. The sickness was like a fire in his gut. It burned right through him.\" He paused beside a pillar, \\nbefore the tomb of a long-dead Stark. \"I loved that old man.\" \\n\"We both did.\" Ned paused a moment. \"Catelyn fears for her sister. How does Lysa bear her grief?\" \\nRobert\\'s mouth gave a bitter twist. \"Not well, in truth,\" he admitted. \"I think losing Jon has driven the \\nwoman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster \\nhim with Tywin Lannister at Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave \\nhim to be raised by women?\" \\nNed would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left his doubts unspoken. \\nSome old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. \"The wife has lost the husband,\" \\nhe said carefully. \"Perhaps-the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.\" \\n\"Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,\" the king swore. \"Lord Tywin had never taken \\na ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The Lannisters are a great and noble House. She \\nPage 28\\n\\nrefused to even hear of it. Then she left in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei \\nwas furious.\" He sighed deeply. \"The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am \\nsworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?\" \\n\"I will take him as ward, if you wish,\" Ned said. \"Lysa should consent to that. She and Catelyn were \\nclose as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.\" \\n\"A generous offer, my friend,\" the king said, \"but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. \\nFostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.\" \\n\"I have more concern for my nephew\\'s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,\" Ned declared. \\n\"That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.\" Robert laughed, the sound rattling among the tombs \\nand bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black \\nbeard. \"Ah, Ned,\" he said, \"you are still too serious.\" He put a massive arm around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"I \\nhad planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see now there\\'s no need for it. Come, walk with \\nme.\" \\nThey started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to follow them as they passed. \\nThe king kept his arm around Ned\\'s shoulder. \"You must have wondered why I finally came north to \\nWinterfell, after so long.\" \\nNed had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. \"For the joy of my company, surely,\" he said \\nlightly. \"And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to \\nthose who man it. The Night\\'s Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says-\" \\n\"No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,\" Robert said. \"The Wall has stood for what, \\neight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have more pressing concerns. These are difficult \\ntimes. I need good men about me. Men like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of \\nthe East, as the Hand of the King. He will not be easy to replace.\" \\n\"His son . . .\" Ned began. \\n\"His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,\" Robert said brusquely. \"No more.\" \\nThat took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. The words came \\nunbidden. \"The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. The title goes with the domain.\" \\n\"Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,\" Robert said. \"I have this year to \\nthink of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, Ned.\" \\n\"In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father\\'s sake if not his own. Surely you \\nowe, Jon that much for his service.\" \\nThe king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned\\'s shoulders. \"Jon\\'s service was the duty he \\nowed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of all men ought to know that. But the son is not the \\nfather. A mere boy cannot hold the east.\" Then his tone softened. \"Enough of this. There is a more \\nimportant office to discuss, and I would not argue with you.\" Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. \"I have \\nneed of you, Ned.\" \\n\"I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.\" They were words he had to say, and so he said them, \\nPage 29\\n\\napprehensive about what might come next. \\nRobert scarcely seemed to hear him. \"Those years we spent in the Eyrie . . . gods, those were good \\nyears. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you down in King\\'s Landing, not up here at the end of \\nthe world where you are no damned use to anybody.\" Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment \\nas melancholy as a Stark. \"I swear to \\nyou, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and \\ncounting coppers is worse. And the people . . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair \\nand listen to them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, money or \\nland or justice. The lies they tell . . . and my lords and ladies are no better. I am surrounded by flatterers \\nand fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of them don\\'t dare tell me the truth, and the other \\nhalf can\\'t find it. There are nights I wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but \\n\"I understand,\" Ned said softly. \\nRobert looked at him. \"I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old friend.\" He smiled. \"Lord \\nEddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.\" \\nNed dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason could Robert have had for \\ncoming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He \\nspoke with the king\\'s voice, commanded the king\\'s armies, drafted the king\\'s laws. At times he even sat \\nupon the Iron Throne to dispense king\\'s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or otherwise \\nindisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm itself. \\nIt was the last thing in the world he wanted. \\n\"Your Grace,\" he said. \"I am not worthy of the honor.\" \\nRobert groaned with good-humored impatience. \"If I wanted to honor you, I\\'d let you retire. I am \\nplanning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I eat and drink and wench myself into an \\nearly grave.\" He slapped his gut and grinned. \"You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?\" \\nNed knew the saying. \"What the king dreams,\" he said, \"the Hand builds.\" \\n\"I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put it. The king eats, they \\nsay, and the Hand takes the shit.\" He threw back his head and roared his laughter. The echoes rang \\nthrough the darkness, and all around them the dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and \\ndisapproving eyes. \\nFinally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes upraised. \"Damn it, \\nNed,\" the king complained. \"You might at least humor me with a smile.\" \\n\"They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man\\'s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to \\ndeath,\" Ned said evenly. \"Perhaps that is why the Starks have so little humor.\" \\n\"Come south with me, and I\\'ll teach you how to laugh again,\" the \\nking promised. \"You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were meant to rule \\ntogether. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound by blood as well as affection. Well, \\nit is not too late. I have a son. You have a daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as \\nPage 30\\n\\nLyanna and I might once have done.\" \\nThis offer did surprise him. \"Sansa is only eleven.\" \\nRobert waved an impatient hand. \"Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can wait a few years.\" The \\nking smiled. \"Now stand up and say yes, curse you.\" \\n\"Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,\" Ned answered. He hesitated. \"These honors are \\nall so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I need to tell my wife . . .\" \\n\"Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.\" The king reached down, clasped Ned by the \\nhand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. \"Just don\\'t keep me waiting too long. I am not the most patient \\nof men.\" \\nFor a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. This was his place, here in the \\nnorth. He looked at the stone figures all around them, breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He \\ncould feel the eyes of the dead. They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. \\nJON \\nThere were times-not many, but a few-when Jon Snow was glad he was a bastard. As he filled his wine \\ncup once more from a passing flagon, it struck him that this might be one of them. \\nHe settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and drank. The sweet, fruity taste \\nof surnmerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile to his lips. \\nThe Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell of roasted meat and \\nfresh-baked bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of \\nStark, Baratheon\\'s crowned stag, the lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a \\nballad, but down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the fire, the \\nclangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken conversations. \\nIt was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon\\'s brothers and sisters had been seated \\nwith the royal children, beneath the raised platform where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and \\nqueen. In honor of the occasion, his lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no \\nmore than that. Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had a \\nthirst for. \\nAnd he was finding that he had a man\\'s thirst, to the raucous delight of the youths around him, who urged \\nhim on every time he drained a glass. They were fine company, and Jon relished the stories they were \\ntelling, tales of battle and bedding and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more \\nentertaining than the king\\'s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their \\nentrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on the bench, and Jon \\nhad gotten a good long look at them all. \\nHis lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as men said. A jeweled tiara \\ngleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father \\nhelped her up the steps to the dais and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. \\nEven at fourteen, Jon could see through her smile. \\nPage 31\\n\\nNext had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king was a great disappointment \\nto Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the \\nfiercest warrior of the realm, a giant among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, \\nsweating through his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. \\nAfter them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk with all the dignity a \\nthree-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he stopped to visit. Close behind came Robb, \\nin grey wool trimmed with white, the Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a \\nwisp of a girl, not quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the shy \\nlooks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she smiled at him. He decided \\nshe was insipid. Robb didn\\'t even have the sense to realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a \\nfool. \\nHis half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young Tommen, whose \\nwhite-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, drew the crown prince, Joffrey \\nBaratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or Robb, but taller than either, to Jon\\'s vast dismay. Prince \\nJoffrey had his sister\\'s hair and his mother\\'s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down \\npast his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside him, but Jon \\ndid not like Joffrey\\'s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked at Winterfell\\'s Great Hall. \\nHe was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen\\'s brothers, the Lannisters of Casterly \\nRock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was \\ntwin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, with flashing green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore \\ncrimson silk, high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was \\nembroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and \\nwhispered \"Kingslayer\" behind his back. \\nJon found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he thought to himself as \\nthe man passed. \\nThen he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother\\'s side. Tyrion Lannister, the \\nyoungest of Lord Tywin\\'s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods had given to Cersei and Jaime, \\nthey had denied Tyrion. He was a dwarf, half his brother\\'s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. \\nHis head was too large for his body, with a brute\\'s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. \\nOne green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. Jon \\nwatched him with fascination. \\nThe last of the high lords to enter were his uncle, Benjen Stark of the Night\\'s Watch, and his father\\'s \\nward, young Theon Greyjoy. Benjen gave Jon a warm smile as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, \\nbut there was nothing new in that. After all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and \\nreturned, and then the feasting began. \\nJon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped. \\nSomething rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring up at him. \"Hungry again?\" \\nhe asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a \\nleg, then had a better idea. He knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his \\nlegs. Ghost ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to bring their \\nwolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at this end of the hall, and no one \\nPage 32\\n\\nhad said a word about his pup. He told himself he was fortunate in that too. \\nHis eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He swallowed another gulp of wine and \\nwatched his direwolf devour the chicken. \\nDogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a black mongrel bitch with \\nlong yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She stopped and edged under the bench to get a share. \\nJon watched the confrontation. The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, \\nsilent, and fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She was three \\ntimes the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood \\nover his prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then thought \\nbetter of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to save her pride. Ghost went \\nback to his meal. \\nJon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The direwolf looked up at him, \\nnipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating. \\n\"Is this one of the direwolves I\\'ve heard so much of?\" a familiar voice asked close at hand. \\nJon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his hair much as Jon had \\nruffled the wolf s. \"Yes,\" he said. \"His name is Ghost.\" \\nOne of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he\\'d been telling to make room at the table for their lord\\'s \\nbrother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with,long legs and took the wine cup out of Jon\\'s hand. \\n\"Summerwine,\" he said after a taste. \"Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?\" \\nJon smiled. \\nBen Stark laughed. \"As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you the first time I got truly and \\nsincerely drunk.\" He snagged a roasted onion, dripping brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit \\ninto it. It crunched. \\nHis uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was always a hint of laughter in his \\nblue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a man of the Night\\'s Watch. Tonight it was rich black \\nvelvet, with high leather boots and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped \\nround his neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. \"A very quiet wolf,\" he \\nobserved. \\n\"He\\'s not like the others,\" Jon said. \"He never makes a sound. That\\'s why I named him Ghost. That, and \\nbecause he\\'s white. The others are all dark, grey or black.\" \\n\"There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.\" Benjen Stark gave Jon a \\nlong look. \"Don\\'t you usually eat at table with your brothers?\" \\n\"Most times,\" Jon answered in a flat voice. \"But tonight Lady Stark thought it might give insult to the \\nroyal family to seat a bastard among them.\" \\n\"I see.\" His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of the hall. \"My brother \\ndoes not seem very festive tonight.\" \\nPage 33\\n\\nJon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the truth that people hid behind \\ntheir eyes. His father was observing \\nall the courtesies, but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, \\nlooking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two seats away, the king had been drinking \\nheavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his great black beard. He made many a toast, \\nlaughed loudly at every jest, and attacked each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed \\nas cold as an ice sculpture. \"The queen is angry too,\" Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. \"Father took \\nthe king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn\\'t want him to go.\" \\nBenjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. \"You don\\'t miss much, do you, Jon? We could use a man \\nlike you on the Wall.\" \\nJon swelled with pride. \"Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I\\'m the better sword, and Hullen says I \\nsit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.\" \\n\"Notable achievements.\" \\n\"Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,\" Jon said in a sudden rush. \"Father will give me leave \\nto go if you ask him, I know he will.\" \\nUncle Benjen studied his face carefully. \"The Wall is a hard place for a boy, Jon.\" \\n\"I am almost a man grown,\" Jon protested. \"I will turn fifteen on my next name day, and Maester Luwin \\nsays bastards grow up faster than other children.\" \\n\"That\\'s true enough,\" Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He took Jon\\'s cup from the table, \\nfilled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down a long swallow. \\n\"Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,\" Jon said. The Young Dragon was \\none of his heroes. \\n\"A conquest that lasted a summer,\" his uncle pointed out. \"Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking \\nthe place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn\\'t a game.\" He \\ntook another sip of wine. \"Also,\" he said, wiping his mouth, \"Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when \\nhe died. Or have you forgotten that part?\" \\n\"I forget nothing,\" Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit very straight, to make \\nhimself seem taller. \"I want to serve in the Night\\'s Watch, Uncle.\" \\nHe had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept around him. Robb would \\nsomeday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon \\nwould be Robb\\'s bannermen and rule holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the \\nheirs of other great houses \\nand go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a bastard hope to earn? \\n\"You don\\'t know what you\\'re asking, Jon. The Night\\'s Watch is a sworn brotherhood. We have no \\nfamilies. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor.\" \\n\"A bastard can have honor too,\" Jon said. \"I am ready to swear your oath.\" \\nPage 34\\n\\n\"You are a boy of fourteen,\" Benjen said. \"Not a man, not yet. Until you have known a woman, you \\ncannot understand what you would be giving up.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care about that!\" Jon said hotly. \\n\"You might, if you knew what it meant,\" Benjen said. \"If you knew what the oath would cost you, you \\nmight be less eager to pay the price, son.\" \\nJon felt anger rise inside him. \"I\\'m not your son!\" \\nBenjen Stark stood up. \"More\\'s the pity.\" He put a hand on Jon\\'s shoulder. \"Come back to me after \\nyou\\'ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we\\'ll see how you feel.\" \\nJon trembled. \"I will never father a bastard,\" he said carefully. \"Never!\" He spat it out like venom. \\nSuddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking at him. He felt the tears \\nbegin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet. \\n\"I must be excused,\" he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and bolted before they could see him \\ncry. He must have drunk more wine than he had realized. His feet got tangled under him as he tried to \\nleave, and he lurched sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. \\nLaughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone tried to steady him. He \\nwrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the \\nnight. \\nThe yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of the inner wall, his cloak \\npulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored and miserable as he huddled there alone, but \\nJon would have traded places with him in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon \\nhad seen an abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the stones \\nkept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him of that tonight. \\nThe sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. They were the last things \\nJon wanted to hear. He wiped \\naway his tears on the sleeve of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go. \\n\"Boy,\" a voice called out to him. Jon turned. \\nTyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, looking for all the world like \\na gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. \"Is that animal a wolf?\" \\n\"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost.\" He stared up at the little man, his disappointment suddenly \\nforgotten. \"What are you doing up there? Why aren\\'t you at the feast?\" \\n\"Too hot, too noisy, and I\\'d drunk too much wine,\" the dwarf told him. \"I learned long ago that it is \\nconsidered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a closer look at your wolf?\" \\nJon hesitated, then nodded slowly. \"Can you climb down, or shall I bring a ladder?\" \\n\"Oh, bleed that,\" the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into empty air. Jon gasped, then \\nPage 35\\n\\nwatched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted \\nbackward onto his legs. \\nGhost backed away from him uncertainly. \\nThe dwarf dusted himself off and laughed. \"I believe I\\'ve frightened your wolf. My apologies.\" \\n\"He\\'s not scared,\" Jon said. He knelt and called out. \"Ghost, come here. Come on. That\\'s it.\" \\nThe wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon\\'s face, but he kept a wary eye on Tyrion Lannister, and \\nwhen the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and bared his fangs in a silent snarl. \"Shy, isn\\'t he?\" \\nLannister observed. \\n\"Sit, Ghost,\" Jon commanded. \"That\\'s it. Keep still.\" He looked up at the dwarf. \"You can touch him \\nnow. He won\\'t move until I tell him to. I\\'ve been training him.\" \\n\"I see,\" Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost\\'s ears and said, \"Nice wolf.\" \\n\"If I wasn\\'t here, he\\'d tear out your throat,\" Jon said. It wasn\\'t actually true yet, but it would be. \\n\"In that case, you had best stay close,\" the dwarf said. He cocked his oversized head to one side and \\nlooked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. \"I am Tyrion Lannister.\" \\n\"I know,\" Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made him feel strange. \\n\"You\\'re Ned Stark\\'s bastard, aren\\'t you?\" \\nJon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and said nothing. \\n\"Did I offend you?\" Lannister said. \"Sorry. Dwarfs don\\'t have to be tactful. Generations of capering fools \\nin motley have won me the right to dress badly and say any damn thing that comes into my head.\" He \\ngrinned. \"You are the bastard, though.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard Stark is my father,\" Jon admitted stiffly. \\nLannister studied his face. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can see it. You have more of the north in you than your \\nbrothers.\" \\n\"Half brothers,\" Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf s comment, but he tried not to let it show. \\n\"Let me give you some counsel, bastard,\" Lannister said. \"Never forget what you are, for surely the \\nworld will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it \\nwill never be used to hurt you.\" \\nJon was in no mood for anyone\\'s counsel. \"What do you know about being a bastard?\" \\n\"All dwarfs are bastards in their father\\'s eyes.\" \\n\"You are your mother\\'s trueborn son of Lannister.\" \\n\"Am I\" the dwarf replied, sardonic. \"Do tell my lord father. MY mother died birthing me, and he\\'s never \\nPage 36\\n\\nbeen sure.\" \\n\"I don\\'t even know who my mother was,\" Jon said. \\n\"Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.\" He favored Jon with a rueful grin. \"Remember this, boy. \\nAll dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs.\" And with that he turned and sauntered \\nback into the feast, whistling a tune. When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow \\nclear across the yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. \\nCATELYN \\n0f all the rooms in Winterfell\\'s Great Keep, Catelyn\\'s bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to \\nlight a fire. The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its \\nwalls and chambers like blood through a man\\'s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass \\ngardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a \\ndozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and \\ndeath. \\nCatelyn\\'s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. The warmth reminded her \\nof Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks \\nwere made for the cold, he would tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly \\nbuilt their castle in the wrong place. \\nSo when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he had a thousand times before. \\nHe crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, and threw open the high narrow windows one by \\none, letting the night air into the chamber. \\nThe wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-handed. Catelyn pulled the \\nfurs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she \\nhad wed in the sept at Riverrun, fifteen long years gone. Her loins \\nstill ached from the urgency of his lovernaking. It was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. \\nShe prayed that it might quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She \\ncould give him another son. \\n\"I will refuse him,\" Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, his voice thick with doubt. \\nCatelyn sat up in the bed. \"You cannot. You must not.\" \\n\"My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert\\'s Hand.\" \\n\"He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other men. If you refuse to serve \\nhim, he will wonder why, and sooner or later he will begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can\\'t you see \\nthe danger that would put us in?\" \\nNed shook his head, refusing to believe. \"Robert would never harm me or any of mine. We were closer \\nthan brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar and curse and bluster, and in a week we will \\nlaugh about it together. I know the man!\" \\nPage 37\\n\\n\"You knew the man,\" she said. \"The king is a stranger to you.\" Catelyn remembered the direwolf dead in \\nthe snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her throat. She had to make him see. \"Pride is everything to a \\nking, my lord. Robert came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw \\nthem back in his face.\" \\n\"Honors?\" Ned laughed bitterly. \\n\"In his eyes, yes,\" she said. \\n\"And in yours?\" \\n\"And in mine,\" she blazed, angry now. Why couldn\\'t he see? \"He offers his own son in marriage to our \\ndaughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the \\nWall to the mountains of Dorne. What is so wrong with that?\" \\n\"Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only eleven,\" Ned said. \"And Joffrey . . . Joffrey is . . .\" \\nShe finished for him. crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I was only twelve when my father \\npromised me to your brother Brandon.\" \\nThat brought a bitter twist to Ned\\'s mouth. \"Brandon. Yes. Brandon would know what to do. He \\nalways did. It was all meant for Brandon. You, Winterfell, everything. He was born to be a King\\'s Hand \\nand a father to queens. I never asked for this cup to pass to me.\" \\n\"Perhaps not,\" Catelyn said, \"but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, and you must drink from it, \\nlike it or not.\" \\nNed turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out \\nin the darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the wall. \\nCatelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in Brandon\\'s place, as custom \\ndecreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay between them, as did the other, the shadow of the \\nwoman he would not name, the woman who had borne him his bastard son. \\nShe was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and unexpected. Ned turned, \\nfrowning. \"What is it?\" \\nDesmond\\'s voice came through the door. \"My lord, Maester Luwin is without and begs urgent \\naudience.\" \\n\"You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?\" \\n\"Yes, my lord. He insists.\" \\n\"Very well. Send him in.\" \\nNed crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized suddenly how cold it had \\nbecome. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. \"Perhaps we should close the windows,\" she \\nsuggested. \\nPage 38\\n\\nNed nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in. \\nThe maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw much. His hair was grey, \\nwhat little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its \\ngreat floppy sleeves had pockets hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and \\nproducing other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. With all he \\nkept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin could lift his arms at all. \\nThe maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. \"My lord,\" he said to Ned, \\n\"pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a message.\" \\nNed looked irritated. \"Been left? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not told.\" \\n\"There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my observatory while I \\nnapped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king\\'s party. We \\nhave had no other visitors from the south.\" \\n\"A wooden box, you say?\" Catelyn said. \\n\"Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. The lenscrafters of Myr are \\nwithout equal.\" \\nNed frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. \"A lens,\" he said. \"What has \\nthat to do with me?\" \\n\"I asked the same question,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Clearly there was more to this than the seeming.\" \\nUnder the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. \"A lens is an instrument to help us see.\" \\n\"Indeed it is.\" He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight around the neck beneath his \\nrobe, each link forged from a different metal. \\nCatelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. \"What is it that they would have us see more \\nclearly?\" \\n\"The very thing I asked myself.\" Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper out of his sleeve. \"I found the \\ntrue message concealed within a false bottom when I dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is \\nnot for my eyes.\" \\nNed held out his hand. \"Let me have it, then.\" \\nLuwin did not stir. \"Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is marked for the eyes of the \\nLady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?\" \\nCatelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the table beside the bed. It was \\nsealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and began to retreat. \\n\"Stay,\" Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. \"What is it? My lady, you\\'re \\nshaking.\" \\n\"I\\'m afraid,\" she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling hands. The furs dropped \\nPage 39\\n\\naway from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. \"It\\'s \\nfrom Lysa.\" Catelyn looked at her husband. \"It will not make us glad,\" she told him. \"There is grief in this \\nmessage, Ned. I can feel it.\" \\nNed frowned, his face darkening. \"Open it.\" \\nCatelyn broke the seal. \\nHer eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she remembered. \"Lysa took \\nno chances. When we were girls together, we had a private language, she and L\" \\n\"Can you read it?\" \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn admitted. \\n\"Then tell us.\" \\n\"Perhaps I should withdraw,\" Maester Luwin said. \\n\"No,\" Catelyn said. \"We will need your counsel.\" She threw back the furs and climbed from the bed. \\nThe night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she padded across the room. \\nMaester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked shocked. \"What are you doing?\" he asked. \\n\"Lighting a fire,\" Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged into it, then knelt over the \\ncold hearth. \\n\"Maester Luwin-\" Ned began. \\n\"Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,\" Catelyn said. \"This is no time for false modesty.\" She slid \\nthe paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier logs on top of it. \\nNed crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held her there, his face inches \\nfrom her. \"My lady, tell me! What was this message?\" \\nCatelyn stiffened in his grasp. \"A warning,\" she said softly. \"If we have the wits to hear.\" \\nHis eyes searched her face. \"Go on.\" \\n\"Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.\" \\nHis fingers tightened on her arm. \"By whom?\" \\n\"The Lannisters,\" she told him. \"The queen.\" \\nNed released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. \"Gods,\" he whispered. His \\nvoice was hoarse. \"Your sister is sick with grief. She cannot know what she is saying.\" \\n\"She knows,\" Catelyn said. \"Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was carefully planned, cleverly \\nhidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the wrong hands. To risk so much, she must have \\nhad more than mere suspicion.\" Catelyn looked to her husband. \"Now we truly have no choice. You \\nPage 40\\n\\nmust be Robert\\'s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.\" \\nShe saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. \"The only truths I know are here. \\nThe south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.\" \\nLuwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his throat. \"The Hand of the King \\nhas great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of Lord Arryn\\'s death, to bring his killers to the king\\'s \\njustice. Power to protect Lady Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.\" \\nNed glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn\\'s heart went out to him, but she knew she \\ncould not take him in her arms just then. First the victory must be won, for her children\\'s sake. \"You say \\nyou love Robert like a brother. Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?\" \\n\"The Others take both of you,\" Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from them and went to the \\nwindow. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent \\nfarewell to the home he loved. When he turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full \\nof melancholy, and moisture glittered \\nfaintly in the corners of his eyes. \"My father went south once, to answer the summons of a king. He \\nnever came home again.\" \\n\"A different time,\" Maester Luwin said. \"A different king.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. \"Catelyn, you shall stay here in \\nWinterfell.\" \\nHis words were like an icy draft through her heart. \"No,\" she said, suddenly afraid. Was this to be her \\npunishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his arms around her? \\n\"Yes,\" Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. \"You must govern the north in my stead, while \\nI run Robert\\'s errands. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he \\nwill be a man grown. He must learn to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your \\ncouncils. He must be ready when his time comes.\" \\n\"Gods will, not for many years,\" Maester Luwin murmured. \\n\"Maester Luwin, I trust you as I would my own blood. Give my wife your voice in all things great and \\nsmall. Teach my son the things he needs to know. Winter is coming.\" \\nMaester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her courage and asked the \\nquestion whose answer she most dreaded. \"What of the other children?\" \\nNed stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. \"Rickon is very young,\" he said \\ngently. \"He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I would take with me.\" \\n\"I could not bear it,\" Catelyn said, trembling. \\n\"You must,\" he said. \"Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give them no grounds to \\nsuspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the ways of a southron court. In a few years \\nshe will be of an age to marry too.\" \\nPage 41\\n\\nSansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew that Arya needed \\nrefinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not Bran. Never Bran. \"Yes,\" she said, \"but \\nplease, Ned, for the love you bear me, let Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.\" \\n\"I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,\" Ned said. \"Ser Rodrik tells me there is bad \\nfeeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a \\nsweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their \\nfriend as Robert became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.\" \\nHe was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She would lose all four of \\nthem, then: Ned, and both girls, and \\nher sweet, loving Bran. Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. \\nWinterfell was such a vast place. \"Keep him off the walls, then,\" she said bravely. \"You know how Bran \\nloves to climb.\" \\nNed kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. \"Thank you, my lady,\" he whispered. \"This is \\nhard, I know.\" \\n\"What of Jon Snow, my lord?\" Maester Luwin asked. \\nCatelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away. \\nMany men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, \\nin the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on \\ncampaign. He had a man\\'s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south \\nwhile she remained safe in her father\\'s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at \\nher breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find \\nbetween battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child\\'s needs. \\nHe did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and \\ncalled him \"son\" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, \\nJon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence. \\nThat cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, \\nand Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband\\'s soldiers. They \\nwhispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys\\'s \\nKingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward \\nNed had carried Ser Arthur\\'s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called \\nStarfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet \\neyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked \\nher husband the truth of it, asked him to his face. \\nThat was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. \"Never ask me about Jon,\" he \\nsaid, cold as ice. \"He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you \\nheard that name, my lady.\" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering \\nhad stopped, and Ashara Dayne\\'s name was never heard in Winterfell again. \\nWhoever Jon\\'s mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would \\npersuade him to send the boy away. It \\nPage 42\\n\\nwas the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but \\nshe had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned\\'s sake, \\nso long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned \\nthan any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. \"Jon must go,\" she said now. \\n\"He and Robb are close,\" Ned said. \"I had hoped . . .\" \\n\"He cannot stay here,\" Catelyn said, cutting him off. \"He is your son, not mine. I will not have him.\" It \\nwas hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at \\nWinterfell. \\nThe look Ned gave her was anguished. \"You know I cannot take him south. There will be no place for \\nhim at court. A boy with a bastard\\'s name . . . you know what they will say of him. He will be shunned.\" \\nCatelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband\\'s eyes. \"They say your friend Robert \\nhas fathered a dozen bastards himself.\" \\n\"And none of them has ever been seen at court!\" Ned blazed. \"The Lann.ister woman has seen to that. \\nHow can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a boy. He-\" \\nHis fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin cut in. \"Another solution \\npresents itself,\" he said, his voice quiet. \"Your brother Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It \\nseems the boy aspires to take the black.\" \\nNed looked shocked. \"He asked to join the Night\\'s Watch?\" \\nCatelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would not be welcome now. Yet \\ngladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a \\nSworn Brother. Jon would be a son to him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would \\ntake the oath as well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn\\'s own \\ngrandchildren for Winterfell. \\nMaester Luwin said, \"There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.\" \\n\"And even a bastard may rise high in the Night\\'s Watch,\" Ned reflected. Still, his voice was troubled. \\n\"Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of \\nfourteen . . .\" \\n\"A hard sacrifice,\" Maester Luwin agreed. \"Yet these are hard times, my lord. His road is no crueler \\nthan yours or your lady\\'s.11 \\nCatelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping silent then. \\nNed turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and thoughtful. Finally he \\nsighed, and turned back. \"Very well,\" he said to Maester Luwin. \"I suppose it is for the best. I will speak \\nto Ben.\" \\n\"When shall we tell Jon?\" the maester asked. \\n\"When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are ready to depart. I would \\nsooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end soon enough, and childhood as well. When the \\nPage 43\\n\\ntime comes, I will tell him myself.\" \\nARYA \\nA rya\\'s stitches were crooked again. \\nShe frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where her sister Sansa sat among the other \\ngirls. Sansa\\'s needlework was exquisite. Everyone said so. \"Sansa\\'s work is as pretty as she is,\" Septa \\nMordane told their lady mother once. \"She has such fine, delicate hands.\" When Lady Catelyn had asked \\nabout Arya, the septa had sniffed. \"Arya has the hands of a blacksmith.\" \\nArya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might have read her thoughts, but \\nthe septa was paying her no attention today. She was sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and \\nadmiration. It was not often that the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, \\nas she had said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella\\'s stitches \\nlooked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way Septa Mordane was cooing. \\nShe studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then sighed and put down the \\nneedle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, \\nSer Rodrik\\'s little girl, was sitting by her feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was \\nleaning over to whisper something in her ear. \\n\"What are you talking about?\" Arya asked suddenly. \\nJeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth blushed. No one answered. \\n\"Tell me,\" Arya said. \\nJeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. Myrcella said something then, \\nand the septa laughed along with the rest of the ladies. \\n\"We were talking about the prince,\" Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss. \\nArya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome one. Sansa got to sit with him \\nat the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. Naturally. \\n\"Joffrey likes your sister,\" Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to do with it. She was the \\ndaughter of Winterfell\\'s steward and Sansa\\'s dearest friend. \"He told her she was very beautiful.\" \\n\"He\\'s going to marry her,\" little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. \"Then Sansa will be queen of all the \\nrealm.\" \\nSansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, Arya thought with dull \\nresentment. \"Beth, you shouldn\\'t make up stories,\" Sansa corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her \\nhair to take the harshness out of her words. She looked at Arya. \"What did you think of Prince Joff, \\nsister? He\\'s very gallant, don\\'t you think?\" \\n\"Jon says he looks like a girl,\" Arya said. \\nPage 44\\n\\nSansa sighed as she stitched. \"Poor Jon,\" she said. \"He gets jealous because he\\'s a bastard.\" \\n\"He\\'s our brother,\" Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the afternoon quiet of the tower \\nroom. \\nSepta Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin lipless mouth made for \\nfrowning. It was frowning now. \"What are you talking about, children?\" \\n\"Our half brother,\" Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. \"Arya and I were \\nremarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us today,\" she said. \\nSepta Mordane nodded. \"Indeed. A great honor for us all.\" Princess Myrcella smiled uncertainly at the \\ncompliment. \"Arya, why aren\\'t you at work?\" the septa asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts \\nrustling as she started across the room. \"Let me see your stitches.\" \\nArya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa\\'s attention. \"Here,\" she said, \\nsurrendering up her work. \\nThe septa examined the fabric. \"Arya, Arya, Arya,\" she said. \"This will not do. This will not do at all.\" \\nEveryone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to smile at her sister\\'s disgrace, \\nbut Jeyne was smirking on her \\nbehalf. Even Princess Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself \\nout of her chair and bolted for the door. \\nSepta Mordane called after her. \"Arya, come back here! Don\\'t you take another step! Your lady mother \\nwill hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! You\\'ll shame us all!\" \\nArya stopped at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were running down her cheeks now. \\nShe managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. \"By your leave, my lady.\" \\nMyrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was uncertain, Septa Mordane \\nwas not. \"Just where do you think you are going, Arya?\" the septa demanded. \\nArya glared at her. \"I have to go shoe a horse,\" she said sweetly, taking a brief satisfaction in the shock \\non the septa\\'s face. Then she whirled and made her exit, running down the steps as fast as her feet would \\ntake her. \\nIt wasn\\'t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the time Arya had been born, \\nthere had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa could sew and dance and sing. She wrote \\npoetry. She knew how to dress. She played the high harp and the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa \\nhad gotten their mother\\'s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took after \\ntheir lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown, and her face was long and solemn. Jeyne used to call \\nher Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better \\nthan her sister was ride a horse. Well, that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a \\nhead for figures. If she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward. \\nNymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She bounded to her feet as soon \\nas she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went \\neverywhere together, and Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden \\nPage 45\\n\\nit, Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane complain about \\nher stitches then. \\nNymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. When they caught the \\nsunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, \\nwho had led her people across the narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had \\nnamed her pup \"Lady.\" Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she \\ngiggled. \\nBy now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, \\nthey would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in \\nthe yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. \"Come,\" she whispered to \\nNymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels. \\nThere was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a \\nview of the whole yard. That was where they headed. \\nThey arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. \\nHe was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf \\nmoved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, \\nsmelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down. \\nJon gave her a curious look. \"Shouldn\\'t you be working on your stitches, little sister?\" \\nArya made a face at him. \"I wanted to see them fight.\" \\nHe smiled. \"Come here, then.\" \\nArya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard \\nbelow. \\nTo her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as \\nthough he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed \\npositively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords \\nunder the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with \\nmagnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, \\nRobb\\'s voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet \\nemblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the \\ncombatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile. \\n\"A shade more exhausting than needlework,\" Jon observed. \\n\"A shade more fun than needlework,\" Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up \\nher hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their father\\'s face, as she did. They were the \\nonly ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and \\nfire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It \\nbeen Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her. \\n64 GEORGL R.R. MARTIN \\n\"Why aren\\'t you down in the yard?\" Arya asked him. \\nPage 46\\n\\nHe gave her a half smile. \"Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes,\" he said. \"Any bruises \\nthey take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.\" \\n\"Oh.\" Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life \\nwas not fair. \\nShe watched her little brother whack at Tommen. \"I could do just as good as Bran,\" she said. \"He\\'s only \\nseven. I\\'m nine.\" \\nJon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. \"You\\'re too skinny,\" he said. He took her \\narm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. \"I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little \\nsister, never mind swing one.\" \\nArya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and \\nTommen circle each other. \\n\"You see Prince Joffrey?\" Jon asked. \\nShe hadn\\'t, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of \\nthe high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of \\nLannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. \\n\"Look at the arms on his surcoat,\" Jon suggested. \\nArya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince\\'s padded surcoat. No doubt the \\nneedlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag \\nof the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister. \\n\"The Lannisters are proud,\" Jon observed. \"You\\'d think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He \\nmakes his mother\\'s House equal in honor to the king\\'s.\" \\n\"The woman is important too!\" Arya protested. \\nJon chuckled. \"Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.\" \\n\"A wolf with a fish in its mouth?\" It made her laugh. \"That would look silly. Besides, if a girl can\\'t fight, \\nwhy should she have a coat of arms?\" \\nJon shrugged. \"Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not \\nmake the rules, little sister.\" \\nThere was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and \\nfailing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised \\nwooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh. \\n\"Enough!\" Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and \\nyanked him back to his feet. \"Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.\" He looked \\naround. \"Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?\" \\nPage 47\\n\\nRobb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. \"Gladly.\" \\nJoffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik\\'s summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He \\nlooked bored. \"This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. \"You are children,\" he said derisively. \\n\"Robb may be a child,\" Joffrey said. \"I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play \\nsword.\" \\n\"You got more swats than you gave, Joff,\" Robb said. \"Are you afraid?\" \\nPrince Joffrey looked at him. \"Oh, terrified,\" he said. \"You\\'re so much older.\" Some of the Lannister men \\nlaughed. \\nJon looked down on the scene with a frown. \"Joffrey is truly a little shit,\" he told Arya. \\nSer Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. \"What are you suggesting?\" he asked the prince. \\n\"Live steel.\" \\n\"Done,\" Robb shot back. \"You\\'ll be sorry!\" \\nThe master-at-arms put a hand on Robb\\'s shoulder to quiet him. \"Live steel is too dangerous. I will \\npermit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.\" \\nJoffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, \\npushed forward in front of the prince. \"This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an \\nedge on his sword, ser?\" \\n\"Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.\" \\n\"Are you training women here?\" the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull. \\n\"I am training knights,\" Ser Rodrik said pointedly. \"They will have steel when they are ready. When they \\nare of an age.\" \\nThe burned man looked at Robb. \"How old are you, boy?\" \\n\"Fourteen,\" Robb said. \\n\"I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.\" \\nArya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. \"Let me do it. I can \\nbeat him.\" \\n\"Beat him with a tourney blade, then,\" Ser Rodrik said. \\nJoffrey shrugged. \"Come and see me when you\\'re older, Stark. If you\\'re not too old.\" There was \\nlaughter from the Lannister men. \\nPage 48\\n\\nRobb\\'s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robb\\'s \\narm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay. \\nJoffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. \"Come, Tommen,\" he said. \"The hour of play \\nis done. Leave the children to their frolics.\" \\nThat brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodrik\\'s face was \\nbeet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the \\nprinces and their party were safely away. \\nJon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of \\nthe godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. \"The show is done,\" he said. He bent to scratch \\nGhost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. \"You had best run back to your \\nroom, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. \\nYou\\'ll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle \\nstill locked tight between your frozen fingers.\" \\nArya didn\\'t think it was funny. \"I hate needlework!\" she said with passion. \"It\\'s not fair!\" \\n\"Nothing is fair,\" Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving \\nsilently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya \\nwas not coming. \\nReluctantly she turned in the other direction. \\nIt was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn\\'t Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane \\nand her mother. \\nBRAN \\nThe hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, \\nso Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, \\nand even the queen\\'s funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the \\nmorrow they left for the south. \\nBran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls \\nwere only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He \\nthought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. \\nHe was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night\\'s Watch. That was almost as good as going \\nsouth with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon. \\nFor days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, \\nnot a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the \\nred castle at King\\'s Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, \\nand dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver \\njust to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? \\nHis father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords. \\nPage 49\\n\\nBran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the \\nfinest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no \\nwives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music \\nto him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins \\nSer Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another\\'s swords hundreds of years ago, when brother \\nfought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. \\nSer Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold. \\nTwo of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, \\nnever quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had \\ndroopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the \\nstories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn\\'t \\ncount anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord \\nCommander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they \\nreached King\\'s Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world \\nhe had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine. \\nYet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had \\never known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the \\nhunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones \\nwho would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who \\nsmiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but \"Hodor,\" the man in the glass \\ngardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit . . . \\nBut it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasn\\'t \\nhis pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just \\nwanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the \\ntears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the \\ngodswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the \\nhounds in his father\\'s kennel and Bran would \\nhave sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing \\nsticks. \\nHe was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa \\nhad named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon \\ncalled his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon\\'s wolf, the white \\none, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn\\'t white. He had tried \\na hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right. \\nFinally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn\\'t been up to the broken tower \\nfor weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance. \\nHe raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. \\nThe heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked \\nlike hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. \"You stay here,\" he told him at the base of the sentinel \\ntree near the armory wall. \"Lie down. That\\'s right. Now stay-\" \\nThe wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a \\nlow branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the \\nwolf got to his feet and began to howl. \\nPage 50\\n\\nBran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill \\nwent through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. \"Quiet,\" he yelled. \"Sit down. \\nStay. You\\'re worse than Mother.\" The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped \\noff onto the armory roof and out of sight. \\nThe rooftops of Winterfell were Bran\\'s second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before \\nhe could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when \\nhe started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true. \\nTo a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels \\nspreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you \\ncouldn\\'t even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some \\nmonstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and \\ntwisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth. \\nWhen he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a \\nglance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all \\nthe \\nlife of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles \\nthat brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the \\ncooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the \\nsilence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of \\nthe castle, in a way even Robb would never know. \\nIt taught him Winterfell\\'s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and \\nvalleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the \\nbell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get \\ninside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a \\nnarrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of \\nwall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didn\\'t know that, Bran was convinced. \\nHis mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he \\nwouldn\\'t, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He \\nhad managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone \\nout the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep. \\nHe confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to \\ncleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his \\ndisobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the \\nupper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove. \\nAs angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. \"You\\'re not my son,\" he told Bran when they \\nfetched him down, \"you\\'re a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your \\nmother see you.\" \\nBran did his best, although he did not think he ever really footed her. Since his father would not forbid it, \\nshe turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was \\nstruck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not \\nimpressed. There were crows\\' nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and \\nPage 51\\n\\nsometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his \\nhand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes. \\nLater, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in \\nBran\\'s clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran \\nif he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, \"I\\'m not made of \\nclay. And anyhow, I never fall.\" \\nThen for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him \\ndown. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always \\nwon. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never \\nsaw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost \\nlike being invisible. \\nHe liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the \\nsmall crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him \\nfeel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. \\nHe liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the \\ncrows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient \\nowl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all. \\nMost of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a \\nway that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Bran\\'s secret place. \\nHis favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long \\ntime ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top \\nthird of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father \\nsent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen \\nstones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now \\nexcept for Bran and the crows. \\nHe knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones \\nwere loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full \\nweight on them. \\nThe best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and \\nthe guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldn\\'t hear you overhead. That brought \\nyou up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was \\ntaller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. \\nYou could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly \\nover empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From \\nthere, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it \\nleaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, \\nand then the crows would come round to see if you\\'d brought any corn. \\nBran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He \\nwas so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life. \\n\"I do not like it,\" a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was \\nPage 52\\n\\ndrifting out of the last window on this side. \"You should be the Hand.\" \\n\"Gods forbid,\" a man\\'s voice replied lazily. \"It\\'s not an honor I\\'d want. There\\'s far too much work \\ninvolved.\" \\nBran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by. \\n\"Don\\'t you see the danger this puts us in?\" the woman said. \"Robert loves the man like a brother.\" \\n\"Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone \\nindigestion.\" \\n\"Don\\'t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will \\nlisten to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would \\nrefuse him.\" \\n\"We ought to count ourselves fortunate,\" the man said. \"The king might as easily have named one of his \\nbrothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and \\nI\\'ll sleep more easily by night.\" \\nThey were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet . . . but they \\nwould see him if he swung out in front of the window. \\n\"We will have to watch him carefully,\" the woman said. \\n\"I would sooner watch you,\" the man said. He sounded bored. \"Come back here.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck,\" the woman \\nsaid. \"Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?\" \\n\"A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get \\naway from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.\" \\n\"His wife is Lady Arryn\\'s sister. It\\'s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.\" \\nBran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to \\nlower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach. \\n\"You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.\" \\n\"That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn\\'s bed.\" \\n\"If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She \\nknew the boy\\'s life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder now that he\\'s safe atop the \\nEyrie.\" \\n\"Mothers.\" The man made the word sound like a curse. \"I think birthing does something to your minds. \\nYou are all mad.\" He laughed. It was a bitter sound. \"Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. \\nWhatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof.\" He paused a moment. \"Or \\nPage 53\\n\\ndoes she?\" \\n\"Do you think the king will require proof?\" the woman said. \"I tell you, he loves me not.\" \\n\"And whose fault is that, sweet sister?\" \\nBran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as \\nhe fell past, pull himself up . . . except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not \\nsure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears. \\n\"You are as blind as Robert,\" the woman was saying. \\n\"If you mean I see the same thing, yes,\" the man said. \"I see a man who would sooner die than betray his \\nking.\" \\n\"He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?\" the woman said. \"Oh, I don\\'t deny he\\'s loyal to \\nRobert, that\\'s obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that \\ncomes to pass, the safer we\\'ll all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside \\nhim will only make him worse. He\\'s still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. \\nHow long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?\" \\nBran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to \\nfind his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who \\nwas talking. \\nThe man sighed. \"You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.\" \\n\"Stop that!\" the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the man\\'s laughter. \\nBran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was the easy way. He \\nmoved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking. \\n\"All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,\" the man said. \"Come here and be quiet.\" \\nBran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. He \\nhung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange \\nupside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow. \\nBran looked in the window. \\nInside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who \\nthey were. The man\\'s back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her \\nup against a wall. \\nThere were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, \\nhis breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting \\nher there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. \"Stop it,\" she said, \"stop it, stop it. Oh, \\nplease . . .\" But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried \\nthemselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast. \\nBran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung \\nPage 54\\n\\nfrom side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen. \\nHe must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. She screamed. \\nEverything happened at once then. \\' The woman pushed the man \\naway wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, \\nbending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He *as in too much of \\na hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his \\npanic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an \\ninstant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He \\nshot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his \\nother hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the \\nbreath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting. \\nFaces appeared in the window above him. \\nThe queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a \\nmirror. \\n\"He saw us,\" the woman said shrilly. \\n\"So he did,\" the man said. \\nBran\\'s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into unyielding \\nstone. The man reached down. \"Take my hand,\" he said. \"Before you fall.\" \\nBran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to the ledge. \"What \\nare you doing?\" the woman demanded. \\nThe man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. \"How old are you, boy?\" \\n\"Seven,\" Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the man\\'s forearm. He let go \\nsheepishly. \\nThe man looked over at the woman. \"The things I do for love,\" he said with loathing. He gave Bran a \\nshove. \\nScreaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The \\ncourtyard rushed up to meet him. \\nSomewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn. \\nPage 55\\n\\nTYRION \\nSomewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a \\nflag of mourning. \\nTyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. \\nSomething about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark \\nforest of the mind, running naked before the pack. \\nWhen the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, \\na hundredyear-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn \\nwith the back of his hand. His reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked \\nthrough the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not \\nmuch a one for sleeping. \\nHis legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and \\nlimped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in \\nfront of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. \"Chayle,\" he \\nsaid softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its \\nsilver chain. \"I\\'m off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the \\nValyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidon\\'s Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is \\nthe only complete copy I\\'ve ever seen.\" Chayle gaped at him, still halfasleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated \\nhis instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks. \\nOutside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep \\nstone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were \\ncut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of \\nWinterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane\\'s rasping voice drifted \\nup to him. \"The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.\" \\nTyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them. \\n\"At least he dies quietly,\" the prince replied. \"It\\'s the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last \\nnight.\" \\nClegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered the black helm over his \\nhead. \"I could silence the creature, if it please you,\" he said through his open visor. His boy placed a \\nlongsword in his hand. He tested the weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard \\nrang to the clangor of steel on steel. \\nThe notion seemed to delight the prince. \"Send a dog to kill a dog!\" he exclaimed. \"Winterfell is so \\ninfested with wolves, the Starks would never miss one.\" \\nTyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. \"I beg to differ, nephew,\" he said. \"The Starks can count \\npast six. Unlike some princes I might name.\" \\nJoffrey had the grace at least to blush. \\nPage 56\\n\\n\"A voice from nowhere,\" Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking this way and that. \"Spirits of \\nthe air!\" \\nThe prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this mummer\\'s farce. Tyrion was used \\nto it. \"Down here.\" \\nThe tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. \"The little lord Tyrion,\" he said. \\n\"My pardons. I did not see you standing there.\" \\n\"I am in no mood for your insolence today.\" Tyrion turned to his nephew. \"Joffrey, it is past time you \\ncalled on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your comfort.\" \\nJoffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. \"What good will my comfort do them?\" \\n\"None,\" Tyrion said. \"Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been noted.\" \\n\"The Stark boy is nothing to me,\" Joffrey said. \"I cannot abide the wailing of women.\" \\nTyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The boy\\'s cheek began to \\nredden. \\n\"One word,\" Tyrion said, \"and I will hit you again.\" \\n\"I\\'m going to tell Mother!\" Joffrey exclaimed. \\nTyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed. \\n\"You tell your mother,\" Tyrion told him. \"But first you get yourself to Lord and Lady Stark, and you fall \\nto your knees in front of them, and you tell them how very sorry you are, and that you are at their service \\nif there is the slightest thing you can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers \\ngo with them. Do you understand? Do you?\" \\nThe boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak nod. Then he turned and \\nfled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion watched him run. \\nA shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead like a cliff. His soot-dark \\narmor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness \\nof a snarling black hound, fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement \\nover Clegane\\'s hideously burned face. \\n\"The prince will remember that, little lord,\" the Hound warned him. The helm turned his laugh into a \\nhollow rumble. \\n\"I pray he does,\" Tyrion Lannister replied. \"If he forgets, be a good dog and remind him.\" He glanced \\naround the courtyard. \"Do you know where I might find my brother?\" \\n\"Breaking fast with the queen.\" \\n\"Ah,\" Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked away as briskly as his \\nstunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first knight to try the Hound today. The man did \\nhave a temper. \\nPage 57\\n\\nA cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest House. Jaime sat at table with \\nCersei and the children, talking in low, hushed voices. \\n\"Is Robert still abed?\" Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the table. \\nHis sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had worn since the day he was \\nborn. \"The king has not slept at all,\" she told him. \"He is with Lord Eddard. He has taken their sorrow \\ndeeply to heart.\" \\n\"He has a large heart, our Robert,\" Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was very little that Jaime took \\nseriously. Tyrion knew that about \\nhis brother, and forgave it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown \\nhim the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to forgive him most \\nanything. \\nA servant approached. \"Bread,\" Tyrion told him, \"and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good \\ndark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns black.\" The man bowed and \\nmoved off. Tyrion turned back to his siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part \\nthis morning. Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a \\nfashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats. \\nTyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather not know. Bad \\nenough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a thought too dreadful to \\ncontemplate. \\nPrince Tommen spoke up. \"Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?\" \\n\"I stopped by the sickroom last night,\" Tyrion announced. \"There was no change. The maester thought \\nthat a hopeful sign.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want Brandon to die,\" Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like his brother, but \\nthen Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves. \\n\"Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,\" Jaime mused. \"One of the hostages murdered by \\nTargaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.\" \\n\"Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,\" Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He ripped off a chunk \\nof black bread. \\nCersei was studying him warily. \"What do you mean?\" \\nTyrion gave her a crooked smile. \"Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The maester thinks the boy \\nmay yet live.\" He took a sip of beer. \\nMyrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children Tyrion was \\nwatching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second, but he did not \\nmiss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. \"That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to \\nlet the child linger in such pain.\" \\nPage 58\\n\\n\"What were the maester\\'s words?\" Jaime asked. \\nThe bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, \"He thinks \\nthat if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has been four days with no change.\" \\n\"Will Bran get better, Uncle?\" little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mother\\'s beauty, and none of her \\nnature. \\n\"His back is broken, little one,\" Tyrion told her. \"The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive \\nwith honey and water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, \\nbut he will never walk again.\" \\n\"If he wakes,\" Cersei repeated. \"Is that likely?\" \\n\"The gods alone know,\" Tyrion told her. \"The maester only hopes.\" He chewed some more bread. \"I \\nwould swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is outside his window day and night, \\nhowling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut \\nout the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.\" \\nThe queen shuddered. \"There is something unnatural about those animals,\" she said. \"They are \\ndangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us.\" \\nJaime said, \"You\\'ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those girls everywhere.\" \\nTyrion started on his fish. \"Are you leaving soon, then?\" \\n\"Not near soon enough,\" Cersei said. Then she frowned. \"Are we leaving?\" she echoed. \"What about \\nyou? Gods, don\\'t tell me you are staying here?\" \\nTyrion shrugged. \"Benjen Stark is returning to the Night\\'s Watch with his brother\\'s bastard. I have a \\nmind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.\" \\nJaime smiled. \"I hope you\\'re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.\" \\nTyrion laughed. \"What, me, celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, \\nI just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.\" \\nCersei stood abruptly. \"The children don\\'t need to hear this filth. Tommen, Myrcella, come.\" She strode \\nbriskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing behind her. \\nJaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. \"Stark will never consent to \\nleave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.\" \\n\"He will if Robert commands it,\" Tyrion said. \"And Robert will command it. There is nothing Lord \\nEddard can do for the boy in any case.\" \\n\"He could end his torment,\" Jaime said. \"I would, if it were my son. It would be a mercy.\" \\n\"I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,\" Tyrion said. \"He would not \\ntake it kindly.\" \\nPage 59\\n\\n\"Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A grotesque. Give me a good \\nclean death.\" \\nTyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. \"Speaking for the grotesques,\" he \\nsaid, \"I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.\" \\nJaime smiled. \"You are a perverse little imp, aren\\'t you?\" \\n\"Oh, yes,\" Tyrion admitted. \"I hope the boy does wake. I would be most interested to hear what he \\nmight have to say.\" \\nHis brother\\'s smile curdled like sour milk. \"Tyrion, my sweet brother,\" he said darkly, \"there are times \\nwhen you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.\" \\nTyrion\\'s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, \\nand grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, \"Why, Jaime, my sweet brother,\" he said, \"you wound me. You know \\nhow much I love my family.\" \\nJON \\non climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever. Ghost padded silently \\nbeside him. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but \\ninside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet. Too quiet for Jon\\'s liking. \\nHe reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at his hand. He took courage \\nfrom that. He straightened, and entered the room. \\nLady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight. Not \\nfor a moment had she left Bran\\'s side. She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, \\nand a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all. She fed him herself, the \\nhoney and water and herb mixture that sustained life. Not once did she leave the room. So Jon had \\nstayed away. \\nBut now there was no more time. \\nHe stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. The window was open. \\nBelow, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head. \\nLady Stark looked over. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. Finally she blinked. \"What \\nareyou doing here?\" she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless. \\n\"I came to see Bran,\" Jon said. \"To say good-bye.\" \\nHer face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She looked as though she had aged \\ntwenty years. \"You\\'ve said it. Now go away.\" \\nPart of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again. He took a \\nnervous step into the room. \"Please,\" he said. \\nPage 60\\n\\nSomething cold moved in her eyes. \"I told you to leave,\" she said. \"We don\\'t want you here.\" \\nOnce that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it only made him \\nangry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night\\'s Watch soon, and face worse dangers than Catelyn \\nTully Stark. \"He\\'s my brother,\" he said. \\n\"Shall I call the guards?\" \\n\"Call them,\" Jon said, defiant. \"You can\\'t stop me from seeing him.\" He crossed the room, keeping the \\nbed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay. \\nShe was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the Bran he remembered. The \\nflesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs \\nbent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. \\nThe fall had shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off \\nto his grave. \\nYet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath. \\n\"Bran,\" he said, \"I\\'m sorry I didn\\'t come before. I was afraid.\" He could feel the tears rolling down his \\ncheeks. Jon no longer cared. \"Don\\'t die, Bran. Please. We\\'re all waiting for you to wake up. Me and \\nRobb and the girls, everyone . . .\" \\nLady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for acceptance. Outside the window, \\nthe direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had not had time to name. \\n\"I have to go now,\" Jon said. \"Uncle Benjen is waiting. I\\'m to go north to the Wall. We have to leave \\ntoday, before the snows come.\" He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the \\njourney. It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his \\ntears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips. \\n\"I wanted him to stay here with me,\" Lady Stark said softly. \\nJon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at him. She was \\n84 GEORGE R.R. MARTM \\ntalking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room. \\n\"I prayed for it,\" she said dully. \"He was my special boy. I went to the sept and prayed seven times to \\nthe seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me. Sometimes prayers \\nare answered.\" \\nJon did not know what to say. \"It wasn\\'t your fault,\" he managed after an awkward silence. \\nHer eyes found him. They were full of poison. \"I need none of your absolution, bastard.\" \\nJon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Bran\\'s hands. He took the other, squeezed it. Fingers like \\nthe bones of birds. \"Good-bye,\" he said. \\nHe was at the door when she called out to him. \"Jon,\" she said. He should have kept going, but she had \\nPage 61\\n\\nnever called him by his name before. He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for \\nthe first time. \\n\"Yes?\" he said. \\n\"It should have been you,\" she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole \\nbody shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry before. \\nIt was a long walk down to the yard. \\nOutside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses \\nwere being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables. A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone \\nwas in an uproar to be off. \\nRobb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He seemed to have grown of \\nlate, as if Bran\\'s fall and his mother\\'s collapse had somehow made him stronger. Grey Wind was at his \\nside. \\n\"Uncle Benjen is looking for you,\" he told Jon. \"He wanted to be gone an hour ago.\" \\n\"I know,\" Jon said. \"Soon.\" He looked around at all the noise and confusion. \"Leaving is harder than I \\nthought.\" \\n\"For me too,\" Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body. \"Did you see him?\" \\nJon nodded, not trusting himself to speak. \\n\"He\\'s not going to die,\" Robb said. \"I know it.\" \\n\"You Starks are hard to kill,\" Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The visit had taken all the strength \\nfrom him. \\nRobb knew something was wrong. \"My mother \\n\"She was . . . very kind,\" Jon told him. \\nRobb looked relieved. \"Good.\" He smiled. \"The next time I see you, you\\'ll be all in black.\" \\nJon forced himself to smile back. \"It was always my color. How long do you think it will be?\" \\n\"Soon enough,\" Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely. \"Farewell, Snow.\" \\nJon hugged him back. \"And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.\" \\n\"I will.\" They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. \"Uncle Benjen said to send you to the \\nstables if I saw you,\" Robb finally said. \\n\"I have one more farewell to make,\" Jon told him. \\n\"Then I haven\\'t seen you,\" Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons \\nand wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the armory. He picked up his package and took the \\nPage 62\\n\\ncovered bridge across to the Keep. \\nArya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was. Nymeria was \\nhelping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp \\nof silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and \\nyelped at them. \\nArya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his \\nneck. \"I was afraid you were gone,\" she said, her breath catching in her throat. \"They wouldn\\'t let me out \\nto say good-bye.\" \\n\"What did you do now?\" Jon was amused. \\nArya disentangled herself from him and made a face. \"Nothing. I was all packed and everything.\" She \\ngestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the \\nroom. \"Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over. My things weren\\'t properly folded, she says. A \\nproper southron lady doesn\\'t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.\" \\n\"Is that what you did, little sister?\" \\n\"Well, they\\'re going to get all messed up anyway,\" she said. \"Who cares how they\\'re folded?\" \\n\"Septa Mordane,\" Jon told her. \"I don\\'t think she\\'d like Nymeria helping, either.\" The she-wolf regarded \\nhim silently with her dark golden eyes. \"It\\'s just as well. I have something for you to take with you, and it \\nhas to be packed very carefully.\" \\nHer face lit up. \"A present?\" \\n\"You could call it that. Close the door.\" \\nWary but excited, Arya checked the hall. \"Nymeria, here. Guard.\" She left the wolf out there to warn of \\nintruders and closed the door. By \\nthen Jon had pulled off the rags he\\'d wrapped it in. He held it out to her. \\nArya\\'s eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. \"A sword,\" she said in a small, hushed breath. \\nThe scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the \\ndeep blue sheen of the steel. \"This is no toy,\" he told her. \"Be careful you don\\'t cut yourself. The edges \\nare sharp enough to shave with.\" \\n\"Girls don\\'t shave,\" Arya said. \\n\"Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septa\\'s legs?\" \\nShe giggled at him. \"It\\'s so skinny.\" \\n\"So are you,\" Jon told her. \"I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos \\nand Myr and the other Free Cities. It won\\'t hack a man\\'s head off, but it can poke him full of holes if \\nyou\\'re fast enough.\" \\nPage 63\\n\\n\"I can be fast,\" Arya said. \\n\"You\\'ll have to work at it every day.\" He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and \\nstepped back. \"How does it feel? Do you like the balance?\" \\n\"I think so,\" Arya said. \\n\"First lesson,\" Jon said. \"Stick them with the pointy end.\" \\nArya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, but Jon found himself \\ngrinning like an idiot. \"I know which end to use,\" Arya said. A doubtful look crossed her face. \"Septa \\nMordane will take it away from me.\" \\n\"Not if she doesn\\'t know you have it,\" Jon said. \\n\"Who will I practice with?\" \\n\"You\\'ll find someone,\" Jon promised her. \"King\\'s Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of \\nWinterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. Run, and ride, make yourself strong. \\nAnd whatever you do . . .\" \\nArya knew what was coming next. They said it together. \\n11 * . . don\\'t . . . tell . . . Sansa!\" \\nJon messed up her hair. \"I will miss you, little sister.\" \\nSuddenly she looked like she was going to cry. \"I wish you were coming with us.\" \\n\"Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows?\" He was feeling better now. He was \\nnot going to let himself be sad. \"I better go. I\\'ll spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I \\nkeep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.\" \\nArya ran to him for a last hug. \"Put down the sword first,\" Jon \\nwarned her, laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses. \\nWhen he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. \"I almost forgot,\" he told \\nher. \"All the best swords have names.\" \\n\"Like Ice,\" she said. She looked at the blade in her hand. \"Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.\" \\n\"Can\\'t you guess?\" Jon teased. \"Your very favorite thing.\" \\nArya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. She was that quick. They said it together: \\n\"Needle!\" \\nThe memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north. \\nPage 64\\n\\nDAENERYS \\nDaenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of \\nPentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man\\'s life must be done beneath the \\nopen sky. \\nDrogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and \\nuncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with their vast \\nherds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos \\nmore anxious with every passing day. \\n\"My fellow magisters; have doubled the size of the city guard,\" Illyrio told them over platters of honey \\nduck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogo\\'s. The khal had joined his \\nkhalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding. \\n\"Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to \\nsellswords and bravos,\" Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered her brother his sword the night \\nDany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly. Mormont had been their constant \\ncompanion ever since. \\nMagister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. \"He can \\nhave her tomorrow, if he \\nlikes,\" her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. \"So long as he pays the \\nprice.\" \\nIllyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. \"I have told you, all is settled. \\nTrust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.\" \\n\"Yes, but when?\" \\n\"When the khal chooses,\" Illyrio said. \"He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his \\nprocession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dolthrak. After that, perhaps. If \\nthe omens favor war.\" \\nViserys seethed with impatience. \"I piss on Dothraki omens. The Usurper sits on my father\\'s throne. \\nHow long must I wait?\" \\nIllyrio gave a massive shrug. \"You have waited most of your life, great king. What is another few months, \\nanother few years?\" \\nSer Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. \"I counsel you to be \\npatient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. A lesser \\nman may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him.\" \\nViserys bristled. \"Guard your tongue, Mormont, or I\\'ll have it out. I am no lesser man, I am the rightful \\nLord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg.\" \\nSer Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck. \\nHoney and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. \\nPage 65\\n\\nThere are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud. \\nYet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. \\nShe ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. \\n\"You woke the dragon,\" he screamed as he kicked her. \"You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.\" \\nHer thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a \\nhideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, \\ngreat columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head \\nslowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She \\nhad never been so afraid . . . \\n. . . until the day of her wedding came at last. \\nThe ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and \\nfighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there Dany was seated \\nbeside \\nKhal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor \\npeople so strange and frightening. The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when \\nthey visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike \\nwore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, \\nand the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on \\nhorseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare\\'s milk and Illyrio\\'s \\nfine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Dany\\'s ears. \\nViserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the \\nchest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khal\\'s own \\nbloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her brother\\'s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, \\nand he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the \\nportions they refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing \\nblacker by the hour at each insult to his person. \\nDany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her brother had told her \\nto smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her \\nbest to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal \\nDrogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and \\nDothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of \\nPentos, but she waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it \\ndown. \\nThere was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and \\nlaughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. They had no common language. \\nDothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of \\nthe Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have \\nwelcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her. \\nSo she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. I \\nam blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the \\nblood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror. \\nThe sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her \\nPage 66\\n\\nfirst man die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without \\nexpression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze \\nmedallion for the women to fight over. \\nThe warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the \\narm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had \\ntold her that might happen. \"The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a \\nkhalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.\" \\nDany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second \\nwarrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men \\nseized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, \\nlong razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and \\nslashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. \\nNo one made a move to interfere. \\nIt ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man \\nmissed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki\\'s waist, \\nand opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the \\nwinner took hold of the nearest woman-not even the one they had been quarreling over-and had her \\nthere and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed. \\nMagister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. \"A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is \\ndeemed a dull affair,\" he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was \\nover, a dozen men had died. \\nAs the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream. She was afraid \\nof the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not \\ntrue men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was \\nafraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant \\nwho sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask. \\nI am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again. \\nWhen at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the \\nshouting and feasting came to a \\nsudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts. \\nAnd after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the \\nconsummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her. She \\nhugged herself to try to keep from shaking. \\nHer brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no \\ndoubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and \\nalmondshaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. \"These are no common servants, sweet \\nsister,\" her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. \"Illyrio and I selected them \\npersonally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in \\nthe womanly arts of love.\" He smiled thinly. \"She\\'s very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that.\" \\nPage 67\\n\\nSer Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. \"It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could \\nafford,\" he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They were histories and songs of the \\nSeven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart. \\nMagister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a \\ngreat cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks \\nthe Free Cities could produce . . . and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany \\ngasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned \\nin such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her \\nhands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or \\ndelicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. \\nThe surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they \\nshimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished \\nbronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked \\nwith gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. \"What \\nare they?\" she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder. \\n\"Dragon\\'s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,\" said Magister Illyrio. \"The eons have turned \\nthem to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.\" \\n\"I shall treasure them always.\" Dany had heard tales of such eggs, \\nbut she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that \\nIllyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her \\nto Khal Drogo. \\nThe khal\\'s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were. \\nHaggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and \\nQotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught \\nher the traditional refusals for these offerings. \"This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, 0 blood of my \\nblood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead.\" And so Khal Drogo too \\nreceived his \"bride gifts.\" \\nOther gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, \\nmedallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny \\nbottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. \"A handsome gift, Khaleesi,\" \\nMagister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. \"Most lucky.\" The gifts mounted up \\naround her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or \\nuse. \\nAnd last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush rippled out from \\nthe center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he \\nreturned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her. \\nShe was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was \\nno ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the breath away. She was grey as the \\nwinter sea, with a mane like silver smoke. \\nHesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse\\'s neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. \\nKhal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated. \"Silver for the silver of your hair, \\nthe khal says.\" \\nPage 68\\n\\n\"She\\'s beautiful,\" Dany murmured. \\n\"She is the pride of the khalasar, \" Illyrio said. \"Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount \\nworthy of her place by the side of the khaL \" \\nDrogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily as if she were a child \\nand set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much smaller than the ones she was used to. Dany sat there \\nuncertain for a moment. No one had told her about this part. \"What should I do?\" she asked Illyrio. \\nIt was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. \"Take the reins and ride. You need not go far.\" \\nNervously Dany gathered the reins.in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a \\nfair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. \\nPraying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch \\nwith her knees. \\nAnd for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time ever. \\nThe silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon \\nthem. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than \\nterrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest \\npressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, \\nand now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. As \\nshe turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, \\nwith no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her \\nhead. \\nThe silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings. \\nWhen she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, \"Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind.\" \\nThe fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new \\nhusband smile for the first time. \\nThe last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then. Dany had lost all \\ntrack of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. \\nAs the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, \\nand said, \"Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken \\nbefore.\" \\nThe fear came back to her then, with her brother\\'s words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen \\nand all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her. \\nThey rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind. Khal \\nDrogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny \\nsilver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. \"I am the blood of the dragon,\" she whispered aloud as \\nshe followed, trying to keep her courage up. \"I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the \\ndragon.\" The dragon was never afraid. \\nAfterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they \\nstopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from \\nPage 69\\n\\nhers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and \\ntrembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began \\nto cry. \\nKhal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. \"No,\" he said. He lifted his hand \\nand rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb. \\n\"You speak the Common Tongue,\" Dany said in wonder. \\n\"No,\" he said again. \\nPerhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and \\nsomehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands \\nbetween his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was \\nwarmth in the tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man. \\nHe put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. Drogo towered \\nover her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on \\na rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their \\nfaces finally at a height. \"No,\" he said. \\n\"Is that the only word you know?\" she asked him. \\nDrogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it over his right \\nshoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward \\nto help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo \\nhis braid. \\nIt took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she was done, he shook his \\nhead, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen \\nhair so long, so black, so thick. \\nThen it was his turn. He began to undress her. \\nHis fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat \\nunmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She \\naverted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. \"No,\" Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from \\nher breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. \"No,\" he repeated. \\n\"No,\" she echoed back at him. \\nHe stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her \\nsilks. The night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. \\nShe was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs \\ncrossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes. \\nAfter a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the fierce strength in his \\nhands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a \\nhand gently down her leg. He stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently \\naround her mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, \\nPage 70\\n\\nmassaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine. \\nIt seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the soft skin \\nunderneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and \\nforefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened \\nand began to ache. \\nHe stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering \\nin her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. \"No?\" he said, and she knew \\nit was a question. \\nShe took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. \"Yes,\" she whispered as she \\nput his finger inside her. \\nEDDARD \\nThe summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey. \\nAlyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to \\nfind his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur \\ncloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. \"Up, \\nStark!\" he roared. \"Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss.\" \\n\"By all means,\" Ned said. \"Come inside, Your Grace.\" Alyn lifted the flap of the tent. \\n\"No, no, no,\" Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. \"The camp is full of ears. Besides, I \\nwant to ride out and taste this country of yours.\" Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a \\ndozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount \\nup. \\nRobert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to \\nkeep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not \\nhear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains \\ndark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert \\nwould not slow. \\nDawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were miles south of \\nthe main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him. \"Gods,\" he swore, \\nlaughing, \"it feels good to get out and tide the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping \\nalong is enough to drive a man mad.\" He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. \"That \\ndamnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a \\nmountain . . . I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, I\\'m going to burn it, and Cersei \\ncan walk!\" \\nNed laughed. \"I will gladly light the torch for you.\" \\n\"Good man!\" The king clapped him on the shoulder. \"I\\'ve half a mind to leave them all behind and just \\nkeep going.\" \\nPage 71\\n\\nA smile touched Ned\\'s lips. \"I do believe you mean it.\" \\n\"I do, I do,\" the king said. \"What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the \\nkingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmer\\'s \\ndaughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.\" \\n\"Would that we could,\" Ned said, \"but we have duties now, my liege . . . to the realm, to our children, I \\nto my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.\" \\n\"You were never the boy you were,\" Robert grumbled. \"More\\'s the pity. And yet there was that one \\ntime . . . what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love \\nher, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was . . . Aleena? No. You told \\nme once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastard\\'s mother?\" \\n\"Her name was Wylla,\" Ned replied with cool courtesy, \"and I would sooner not speak of her.\" \\n\"Wylla. Yes.\" The king grinned. \"She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard \\nStark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like . . .\" \\nNed\\'s mouth tightened in anger. \"Nor will 1. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I \\ndishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.\" \\n\"Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.\" \\n\"I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.\" \\n\"You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in \\nher bed.\" He slapped a hand on his knee. \"Well, I\\'ll not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I \\nswear, at times you\\'re so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.\" \\nThe rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath \\nthem, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out \\nto his king. \"The barrows of the First Men.\" \\nRobert frowned. \"Have we ridden onto a graveyard?\" \\n\"There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,\" Ned told him. \"This land is old.\" \\n\"And cold,\" Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well \\nbehind them, at the bottom of the ridge. \"Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker \\nabout your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in King\\'s Landing. Here.\" The king \\npulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned. \\nVarys the eunuch was the king\\'s master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served \\nAerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, \\nbut the message did not concern Lady Arryn. \"What is the source for this information?\" \\n\"Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?\" \\n\"Would that I might forget him,\" Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, \\nproud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the \\nPage 72\\n\\nfamily coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the \\nStarks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to \\nfind when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the king\\'s justice. Five years \\nhad passed since then. \\n\"Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile,\" \\nRobert explained. \"Lord Varys makes good use of him.\" \\n\"So the slaver has become a spy,\" Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. \"I would rather he \\nbecome a corpse.\" \\n\"Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,\" Robert said. \"Jorah aside, what do you make of \\nhis report?\" \\n\"Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?\" \\nThe king frowned. \"A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.\" \\nNed did not feign surprise; Robert\\'s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. He remembered \\nthe angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of \\nRhaegar\\'s wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that \\n100 GLORGE R.R. MARTIN \\nmurder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more \\nthan babes, his new-made king had replied, \"I see no babes. Only dragonspawn.\" Not even Jon Arryn \\nhad been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the \\nlast battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna\\'s death, \\nand the grief they had shared over her passing. \\nThis time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. \"Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. You are \\nno Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.\" It was said that Rhaegar\\'s little girl had cried as they dragged \\nher from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord \\nTywin\\'s soldiers had torn him from his mother\\'s breast and dashed his head against a wall. \\n\"And how long will this one remain an innocent?\" Robert\\'s mouth grew hard. \"This child will soon enough \\nspread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.\" \\n\"Nonetheless,\" Ned said, \"the murder of children . . . it would be vile . . . unspeakable . . .\" \\n\"Unspeakable?\" the king roared. \"What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable. The way \\nyour lord father died, that was unspeakable. And Rhaegar . . . how many times do you think he raped \\nyour sister? How many hundreds of times?\" His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied \\nnervously beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at \\nNed. \"I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I \\nwill piss on their graves.\" \\nNed knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not quenched Robert\\'s \\nthirst for revenge, no words of his would help. \"You can\\'t get your hands on this one, can you?\" he said \\nquietly. \\nPage 73\\n\\nThe king\\'s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. \"No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden Pentoshi \\ncheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around \\nthem, and now he\\'s handed them over to the Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, \\nwhen it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool 1, 1 listened to him.\" \\n\"Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.\" \\nRobert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. \"This Khal Drogo is said to have \\na hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?\" \\n\"He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the \\nother side of the narrow sea,\" \\nNed replied calmly. \"The barbarians have no ships. They hate and fear the open sea.\" \\nThe king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. \"Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, \\nthough. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call \\nme Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for \\nnow, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar \\nking crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.\" \\n\"He will not cross,\" Ned promised. \"And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the \\nsea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East-\" \\nThe king groaned. \"For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the boy is your \\nnephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the \\nrealm on the shoulders of a sickly child.\" \\nNed was ready for that. \"Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will not do, name \\none of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storm\\'s End, surely.\" \\nHe let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He looked uncomfortable. \\n\"That is,\" Ned finished quietly, watching, \"unless you have already promised the honor to another.\" \\nFor a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became annoyance. \\n\"What if I have?\" \\n\"It\\'s Jaime Lannister, is it not?\" \\nRobert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows. Ned kept \\npace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. \"Yes,\" he said at last. A single hard word to end \\nthe matter. \\n\"Kingslayer,\" Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. \"An \\nable and courageous man, no doubt,\" he said carefully, \"but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In \\ntime Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West.\" He left unsaid \\nhis real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters. \\nPage 74\\n\\n\"I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,\" the king said stubbornly. \"At the moment, \\nLord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. \\nDon\\'t vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.\" \\n\"Your Grace, may I speak frankly?\" \\n\"I seem unable to stop you,\" Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown grasses. \\n\"Can you trust Jaime Lannister?\" \\n\"He is my wife\\'s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to \\nmine.\" \\n\"As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen\\'s,\" Ned pointed out. \\n\"Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win the \\nthrone I sit on.\" \\nHis sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his \\nlips. \"He swore a vow to protect his king\\'s life with his own. Then he opened that king\\'s throat with a \\nsword.\" \\n\"Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!\" Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an \\nancient barrow. \"If Jaime hadn\\'t done it, it would have been left for you or me.\" \\n\"We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,\" Ned said. The time had come for Robert to hear the \\nwhole truth, he decided then and there. \"Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?\" \\n\"I won my crown there. How should I forget it?\" \\n\"You took a wound from Rhaegar,\" Ned reminded him. \"So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, \\nyou gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegar\\'s army fled back to King\\'s Landing. We \\nfollowed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed \\nto us.\" \\nRobert gave an impatient shake of his head. \"Instead you found that our men had already taken the city. \\nWhat of it?\" \\n\"Not our men,\" Ned said patiently. \"Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the \\ncrowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.\" \\nThe war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert\\'s banners; others \\nhad remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had \\nremained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen \\nmust have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before \\nthe gates of King\\'s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had \\nordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate. \\n\"Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,\" Robert said. The anger was building in him again. \\nPage 75\\n\\n\"Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it.\" \\n\"You were not there,\" Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled \\nsleep was no stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. \\n\"There was no honor in that conquest.\" \\n\"The Others take your honor!\" Robert swore. \"What did any Targaryen ever know of honor? Go down \\ninto your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon\\'s honor!\" \\n\"You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,\" Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me, Ned, she had \\nwhispered. \\n\"That did not bring her back.\" Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. \"The gods be damned. It \\nwas a hollow victory they gave me. A crown . . . it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe . . . \\nand mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods \\nmock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.\" \\n\"I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace . . . only for what I found when I rode into the throne room \\nthat day,\" Ned said. \"Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared \\ndown from the walls. Lannister\\'s men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard \\nover his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, \\nhigh above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion\\'s head. How he glittered!\" \\n\"This is well known,\" the king complained. \\n\"I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. It felt \\nas though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His \\ngolden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a king\\'s blood. My men were filling the room behind \\nme. Lannister\\'s men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I \\nwaited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, \\'Have no fear, Stark. I \\nwas only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It\\'s not a very comfortable seat, I\\'m afraid.\\' \" \\nThe king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown \\ngrass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. \"You think I should mistrust Lannister because he \\nsat on my throne for a few moments?\" He shook with laughter again. \"Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. \\nScarce more than a boy.\" \\n\"Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.\" \\n\"Perhaps he was tired,\" Robert suggested. \"Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, there\\'s no place \\nelse to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In \\nmore ways than one.\" The king shook his head. \"Well, now I know \\nJaime\\'s dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters \\nof state, Ned. It\\'s all as tedious as counting coppers. Come, let\\'s ride, you used to know how. I want to \\nfeel the wind in my hair again.\" He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, \\nPage 76\\n\\nraining earth down behind him. \\nFor a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of \\nhelplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was \\nno Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, \\nas he always had, and nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He \\nbelonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran. \\nA man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put his boots into his \\nhorse and set off after the king. \\nTYRION \\nThe north went on forever. \\nTyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the \\nkingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another. \\nThey had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, \\nriding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of \\nthe queen\\'s huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the \\nsprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders \\nturned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew. \\nIt had grown colder after that, and far more quiet. \\nWest of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To the \\neast the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could \\nsee. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts \\nwalled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude \\ninns to be found. \\nThree days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to \\ndense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, \\nuntil by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and \\nsnow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the \\nhigh peaks like banners. \\nWith the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of \\noak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. \"The \\nwolfswood,\" Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, \\nand some not so distant. Jon Snow\\'s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never \\nraised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought. \\nPage 77\\n\\nThere were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as \\nbefit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night\\'s \\nWatch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest \\nholdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and \\nsinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root \\nand as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. \"Rapers,\" Yoren \\nsaid with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no \\ndoubt it was preferable to castration. \\nFive men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by \\nMaester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road. \\nTyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that \\nlooked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard \\nwere matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young \\nrecruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel. \\nNo doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night\\'s Watch was made up of men like his \\nuncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had \\nchosen a hard life . . . or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him. \\nHe had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brother\\'s distaste for \\nLannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions. \"I warn you, \\nLannister, you\\'ll find no inns at the Wall,\" he had said, looking down on him. \\n\"No doubt you\\'ll find some place to put me,\" Tyrion had replied. \"As you might have noticed, I\\'m small.\" \\nOne did not say no to the queen\\'s brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but Stark had not \\nbeen happy. \"You will not like the ride, I promise you that,\" he\\'d said curtly, and since the moment they \\nset out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise. \\nBy the end of the first week, Tyrion\\'s thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were cramping badly, \\nand he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that \\nsatisfaction. \\nHe took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark \\nhad offered it to him in an excess of Night\\'s Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously \\ndecline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode \\nout of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and \\ngrowing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a knife \\ncutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. \\nPerhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters \\ntook what was offered. \\nFarms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness \\nof the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on \\ntheir own resources. \\nPage 78\\n\\nTyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. \\nSo while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it \\nbecame his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read. \\nOn the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he \\nhad brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and \\nproperties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Stark\\'s permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes \\nfrom the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north. \\nHe found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with \\nwaters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion \\ncurled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the \\nwine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high \\niron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly \\nimpervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so \\narmed can outrange any wooden bow. \\nTyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to King\\'s Landing for his sister\\'s \\nwedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the \\nwalls of Targaryen\\'s throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but \\nTyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored. \\nHe had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them \\nbeautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light \\nof his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. He\\'d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls \\nand made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of \\nblack diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater \\nfires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beast\\'s empty eye sockets had \\nwatched him go. \\nThere were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere \\ncentury and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiffs skulls, \\nand oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the \\nlast of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long. \\nFrom there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons \\nthat Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given \\nthem the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, \\nwordless and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar\\'s gullet, although you would not have \\nridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could \\nhave swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes \\nbeyond the Port of Ibben. \\nTyrion stood in that dank cellar for a long time, staring at Balerion\\'s huge, empty-eyed skull until his \\ntorch burned low, trying to grasp the size of the living animal, to imagine how it must have looked when it \\nspread its great black wings and swept across the skies, breathing fire. \\nA GAML OF THRONES 109 \\nPage 79\\n\\nHis own remote ancestor, King Loren of the Rock, had tried to stand against the fire when he joined \\nwith King Mern of the Reach to oppose the Targaryen conquest. That was close on three hundred years \\nago, when the Seven Kingdoms were kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between \\nthem, the Two Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times as \\nmany freeriders and men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that number, the chroniclers \\nsaid, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of the last king he had slain, their loyalties \\nuncertain. \\nThe hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat ripe for harvest. When the \\nTwo Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and shattered and began to run. For a few moments, \\nthe chroniclers wrote, the conquest was at an end . . . but only for those few moments, before Aegon \\nTargaryen and his sisters joined the battle. \\nIt was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed at once. The singers called \\nit the Field of Fire. \\nNear four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had \\nescaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for \\nwhich Tyrion was duly grateful. \\n\"Why do you read so much?\" \\nTyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him \\ncuriously. He closed the book on a finger and said, \"Look at me and tell me what you see.\" \\nThe boy looked at him suspiciously. \"Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister.\" \\nTyrion sighed. \"You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, \\ntwelve?\" \\n\"Fourteen,\" the boy said. \\n\"Fourteen, and you\\'re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. \\nI require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be \\ninterested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I \\nwill never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me \\nto some slaver\\'s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are \\nall the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My \\nbrother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister \\nmarried the new king and my \\nrepulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn\\'t you \\nagree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer \\nto think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. \\nMy mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my \\nmind . . . and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.\" Tyrion tapped \\nthe leather cover of the book. \"That\\'s why I read so much, Jon Snow.\" \\nPage 80\\n\\nThe boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face \\nthat gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son. \"What are \\nyou reading about?\" he asked. \\n\"Dragons,\" Tyrion told him. \\n\"What good is that? There are no more dragons,\" the boy said with the easy certainty of youth. \\n\"So they say,\" Tyrion replied. \"Sad, isn\\'t it? When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of \\nmy own.\" \\n\"You did?\" the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him. \\n\"Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when he\\'s seated on a \\ndragon\\'s back.\" Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. \"I used to start fires in the \\nbowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes \\nI\\'d imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister.\" Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts \\nhorror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. \"Don\\'t look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. \\nYou\\'ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.\" \\n\"No,\" Jon Snow said, horrified. \"I wouldn\\'t . . .\" \\n\"No? Never?\" Tyrion raised an eyebrow. \"Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you. I\\'m \\ncertain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your brother Robb, he\\'s always been \\nkind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father . . . he must have good \\nreasons for packing you off to the Night\\'s Watch \\n\"Stop it,\" Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. \"The Night\\'s Watch is a noble calling!\" \\nTyrion laughed. \"You\\'re too smart to believe that. The Night\\'s Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits \\nof the realm. I\\'ve seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how \\ndo you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up \\non the Wall, watching for \\ngrumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part is \\nthere are no grumkins or snarks, so it\\'s scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls \\noff, but since you\\'re not allowed to breed anyway, I don\\'t suppose that matters.\" \\n\"Stop it!\" the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears. \\nSuddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat \\non the shoulder or mutter some word of apology. \\nHe never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he was walking toward Snow \\nand the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from him as he \\nfell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. \\nAs he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his \\nteeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. \"Help me,\" he said to the \\nboy, reaching up a hand. \\nPage 81\\n\\nAnd suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never made a sound. He \\nonly looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. \\nTyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt. \"Don\\'t help me, then. I\\'ll sit right here until you leave.\" \\nJon Snow stroked Ghost\\'s thick white fur, smiling now. \"Ask me nicely.\" \\nTyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was not the first time in \\nhis life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. \"I should be \\nvery grateful for your kind assistance, Jon,\" he said mildly. \\n\"Down, Ghost,\" the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left Tyrion. Jon \\ncame around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. Then he picked \\nup the book and handed it back. \\n\"Why did he attack me\\'?\" Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt \\nfrom his mouth with the back of his hand. \\n\"Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.\" \\nTyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out \\nthrough his nose entirely without his permission. \"Oh, gods,\" he said, choking on his laughter and shaking \\nhis head, \"I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?\" \\n\"You don\\'t want to know.\" Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion. \\nTyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. The wine was \\ncool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. \"Want \\nsome?\" \\nThe boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. \"It\\'s true, isn\\'t it?\" he said when he was done. \"What \\nyou said about the Night\\'s Watch.\" \\nTyrion nodded. \\nJon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. \"If that\\'s what it is, that\\'s what it is.\" \\nTyrion grinned at him. \"That\\'s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.\" \\n\"Most men,\" the boy said. \"But not you.\" \\n\"No,\" Tyrion admitted, \"not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no dragons.\" He \\nscooped up the fallen bearskin. \"Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the \\nbanners.\" \\nThe walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time \\nthey got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him \\noff. He would make his own way, as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters \\nhad been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. \\nPage 82\\n\\nThe horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. The savory \\nsmell of stew filled Tyrion\\'s nostrils. He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the \\nstewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. \"More pepper,\" \\nhe said. \\nBenjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. \"There you are. Jon, damn it, don\\'t \\ngo off like that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten you.\" \\n\"It was the grumkins,\" Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot a baffled look at Yoren. \\nThe old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work. \\nThe squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night \\naround their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. One by one the \\ncompany drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night\\'s first \\nwatch. \\nTyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he \\npaused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep \\ninto the flames. \\nTyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. \\nCATELYN \\nNed and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Bran\\'s sickroom, \\ncarrying a reading lamp and the books of account. \"It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady,\" \\nhe said. \"You\\'ll want to know how much this royal visit cost us.\" \\nCatelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. It had grown very \\nlong, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. \"I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,\" she \\ntold him, never taking her eyes from Bran. \"I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away.\" \\n\"My lady, the king\\'s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores before-\" \\nShe cut him off. \"I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our needs.\" \\n\"We have no steward,\" Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let \\ngo. \"Poole went south to establish Lord Eddard\\'s household at King\\'s Landing.\" \\nCatelyn nodded absently. \"Oh, yes. I remember.\" Bran looked so pale. She wondered whether they \\nmight move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun. \\nMaester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. \"There are several \\nappointments that require your immediate \\nPage 83\\n\\nattention, my lady. Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory\\'s place, a new \\nmaster of horse-\" \\nHer eyes snapped around and found him. \"A master of horse?\" Her voice was a whip. \\nThe maester was shaken. \"Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so-\" \\n\"My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? Do you \\nthink I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher \\nevery horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Bran\\'s eyes, do you understand that? Do \\nyou?\" \\nHe bowed his head. \"Yes, my lady, but the appointments-\" \\n\"I\\'ll make the appointments,\" Robb said. \\nCatelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She had been \\nshouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to her? She was so tired, and \\nher head hurt all the time. \\nMaester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. \"I have prepared a list of those we might wish to \\nconsider for the vacant offices,\" he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve. \\nHer son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the \\ncold, his hair shaggy and windblown. \"Good men,\" he said. \"We\\'ll talk about them tomorrow.\" He \\nhanded back the list of names. \\n\"Very good, my lord.\" The paper vanished into his sleeve. \\n\"Leave us now,\" Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door behind him \\nand turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. \"Mother, what are you doing?\" \\nCatelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he had the Tully \\ncoloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in \\nhis face, something as stern and hard as the north. \"What am I doing?\" she echoed, puzzled. \"How can \\nyou ask that? What do you imagine I\\'m doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of \\nBran.\" \\n\"Is that what you call it? You haven\\'t left this room since Bran was hurt. You didn\\'t even come to the \\ngate when Father and the girls went south.\" \\n\"I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window.\" She had begged Ned \\nnot to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldn\\'t he see that? It \\nwas no use. He had no choice, he had told her, and then he left, choosing. \"I can\\'t leave him, even for a \\nmoment, not when any moment \\ncould be his last. I have to be with him, if ... if .\"She took her son\\'s limp hand, sliding his fingers \\nthrough her own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the \\nwarmth of life through his skin. \\nPage 84\\n\\nRobb\\'s voice softened. \"He\\'s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger \\nhas passed.\" \\n\"And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and I\\'m not here?\" \\n\"Rickon needs you,\" Robb said sharply. \"He\\'s only three, he doesn\\'t understand what\\'s happening. He \\nthinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don\\'t \\nknow what to do with him.\" He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he\\'d done when he \\nwas little. \"Mother, I need you too. I\\'m trying but I can\\'t . . . I can\\'t do it all by myself.\" His voice broke \\nwith sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go \\nto him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move. \\nOutside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second. \\n\"Bran\\'s.\" Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The howling grew \\nlouder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair. \\n\"Don\\'t,\" she told him. \"Bran needs to stay warm.\" \\n\"He needs to hear them sing,\" Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in \\nchorus with the first. Then a third, closer. \"Shaggydog and Grey Wind,\" Robb said as their voices rose \\nand fell together. \"You can tell them apart if you listen close.\" \\nCatelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the \\nhowling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy \\nlying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and \\ndreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand \\nfree of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. \"Make them stop!\" she cried. \"I can\\'t stand \\nit, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!\" \\nShe didn\\'t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in \\nstrong arms. \"Don\\'t be afraid, Mother. They would never hurt him.\" He helped her to her narrow bed in \\nthe corner of the sickroom. \"Close your eyes,\" he said gently. \"Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you\\'ve \\nhardly slept since Bran\\'s fall.\" \\n\"I can\\'t,\" she wept. \"Gods forgive me, Robb, I can\\'t, what if he dies \\nwhile I\\'m asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies . . .\" The wolves were still howling. She screamed and \\nheld her ears again. \"Oh, gods, close the window!\" \\n\"If you swear to me you\\'ll sleep.\" Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another \\nsound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. \"Dogs,\" he said, listening. \"All the dogs are \\nbarking. They\\'ve never done that before . . .\" Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she \\nlooked up, his face was pale in the lamplight. \"Fire, \" he whispered. \\nFire, she thought, and then, Bran! \"Help me,\" she said urgently, sitting up. \"Help me with Bran.\" \\nRobb did not seem to hear her. \"The library tower\\'s on fire,\" he said. \\nPage 85\\n\\nCatelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged with relief. Bran \\nwas safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. \"Thank the \\ngods,\" she whispered. \\nRobb looked at her as if she\\'d gone mad. \"Mother, stay here. I\\'ll come back as soon as the fire\\'s out.\" \\nHe ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a \\nwild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time. \\nOutside, there were shouts of \"Fire!\" in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened \\nhorses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to \\nthe cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent. \\nCatelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window. Across the \\nbailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the \\nsky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the \\nshutters. \\nWhen she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her. \\n\"You weren\\'t s\\'posed to be here,\" he muttered sourly. \"No one was s\\'posed to be here.\" \\nHe was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who \\nworked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes \\ndeep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand. \\nCatelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. \"No,\" she said. The word stuck in her throat, the merest \\nwhisper. \\nHe must have heard her. \"It\\'s a mercy,\" he said. \"He\\'s dead already.\" \\n\"No,\" Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. \"No, you can\\'t.\" She spun back toward the \\nwindow to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. One hand clamped \\ndown over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The \\nstench of him was overwhelming. \\nShe reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it away from her \\nthroat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were slippery with blood, but she would not let go \\nof the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her \\nhead to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his \\npalm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let \\ngo. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and \\npulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, \\nbreathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. \"You \\nweren\\'t s\\'posed to be here,\" he repeated stupidly. \\nCatelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble, less than a \\nsnarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he started to turn just as \\nthe wolf made its leap. They went down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where she\\'d fallen. The \\nPage 86\\n\\nwolf had him under the jaw. The man\\'s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back \\nits head, taking out half his throat. \\nHis blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face. \\nThe wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room. It \\nwas Bran\\'s wolf, she realized. Of course it was. \"Thank you,\" Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny. \\nShe lifted her hand, trembling. The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood \\nwith a wet rough tongue. When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and \\njumped up on Bran\\'s bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to laugh hysterically. \\nThat was the way they found them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the \\nguards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and \\nled her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers. Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a \\nscalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth. \\nAfterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in \\nA CAME OF THRONES 119 \\nher fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he\\'d pulled out a \\nhandful of hair. The maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk of the poppy to \\nhelp her sleep. \\nFinally she closed her eyes. \\nWhen she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. Catelyn nodded and sat up in \\nbed. It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Bran\\'s fall, a terrible dream of blood and \\ngrief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet \\nstrangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her. \\n\"Bring me some bread and honey,\" she told her servants, \"and take word to Maester Luwin that my \\nbandages want changing.\" They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding. \\nCatelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She had let them all down, \\nher children, her husband, her House. It would not happen again. She would show these northerners how \\nstrong a Tully of Riverrun could be. \\nRobb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her husband\\'s ward Theon Greyjoy, \\nand lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard. He was the new captain of \\nthe guard, Robb said. Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at \\nhis waist. \\n\"Who was he?\" Catelyn asked them. \\n\"No one knows his name,\" Hallis Mollen told her. \"He was no man of Winterfell, m\\'lady, but some says \\nthey seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.\" \\n\"One of the king\\'s men, then,\" she said, \"or one of the Lannisters\\'. He could have waited behind when \\nthe others left.\" \\nPage 87\\n\\n\"Maybe,\" Hal said. \"With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, there\\'s no way of saying who he \\nbelonged to.\" \\n\"He\\'d been biding in your stables,\" Greyjoy said. \"You could smell it on him.\" \\n\"And how could he go unnoticed?\" she said sharply. \\nHallis Mollen looked abashed. \"Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to \\nthe Night\\'s Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys. Could \\nbe Hodor saw him, the talk is that boy\\'s been acting queer, but simple as he is . . .\" Hal shook his head. \\n\"We found where he\\'d been sleeping,\" Robb put in. \"He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried \\nbeneath the straw.\" \\n\"It\\'s good to know my son\\'s life was not sold cheaply,\" Catelyn said bitterly. \\nHallis Mollen looked at her, confused. \"Begging your grace, m\\'lady, you saying he was out to kill your \\nboy?\" \\nGreyjoy was doubtful. \"That\\'s madness.\" \\n\"He came for Bran,\" Catelyn said. \"He kept muttering how I wasn\\'t supposed to be there. He set the \\nlibrary fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. If I hadn\\'t been half-mad with \\ngrief, it would have worked.\" \\n\"Why would anyone want to kill Bran?\" Robb said. \"Gods, he\\'s only a little boy, helpless, sleeping . . .\" \\nCatelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. \"If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things \\nthrough, Robb. Answer your own question. Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?\" \\nBefore he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen. There was \\nmuch more than she\\'d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and blackberry preserves, a rasher of \\nbacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin. \\n\"How is my son, Maester?\" Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite. \\nMaester Luwin lowered his eyes. \"Unchanged, my lady.\" \\nIt was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade \\nwere still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb. \"Do you have the \\nanswer yet?\" \\n\"Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,\" Robb said, \"afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of \\nsomething he knows.\" \\nCatelyn was proud of him. \"Very good.\" She turned to the new captain of the guard. \"We must keep \\nBran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.\" \\n\"How many guards do you want, rn\\'lady?\" Hal asked. \\nPage 88\\n\\n\"So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,\" she told him. \\nRobb stood a little taller. \"Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the \\nbottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mother\\'s.\" \\n\"As you say, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"Do it now,\" Catelyn suggested. \\n\"And let his wolf stay in the room with him,\" Robb added. \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn said. And then again: \"Yes.\" \\nHallis Mollen bowed and left the room. \\n\"Lady Stark,\" Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, \"did you chance to notice the dagger the \\nkiller used?\" \\n\"The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge,\" Catelyn replied \\nwith a dry smile. \"Why do you ask?\" \\n\"We found the knife still in the villain\\'s grasp. It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon \\nfor such a man, so I looked at it long and hard. The blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. A \\nweapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him. Someone gave it to him.\" \\nCatelyn nodded, thoughtful. \"Robb, close the door.\" \\nHe looked at her strangely, but did as she told him. \\n\"What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,\" she told them. \"I want your oaths on that. If even \\npart of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong \\nears could mean their lives.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard is a second father to me,\" said Theon Greyjoy. \"I do so swear.\" \\n\"You have my oath,\" Maester Luwin said. \\n\"And mine, my lady,\" echoed Ser Rodrik. \\nShe looked at her son. \"And you, Robb?\" \\nHe nodded his consent. \\n\"My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King,\" \\nCatelyn told them. \"It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell. He \\nremained here in the castle.\" The room was deathly quiet. \"I do not think Bran fell from that tower,\" she \\nsaid into the stillness. \"I think he was thrown.\" \\nPage 89\\n\\nThe shock was plain on their faces. \"My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,\" said Rodrik Cassel. \"Even \\nthe Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.\" \\n\"Oh, would he?\" Theon Greyjoy asked. \"I wonder.\" \\n\"There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,\" Catelyn said. \\n\"The boy had always been surehanded in the past,\" Maester Luwin said thoughtfully. \"He knew every \\nstone in Winterfell.\" \\n\"Gods, \" Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. \"If this is true, he will pay for it.\" He drew his \\nsword and waved it in the air. \"I\\'ll kill him myself!\" \\nSer Rodrik bristled at him. \"Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away. Never draw \\nyour sword unless you mean to use it. How many times must I tell you, foolish boy?\" \\n122 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN \\nAbashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik, \"I see my son is \\nwearing steel now.\" \\nThe old master-at-arms said, \"I thought it was time.\" \\nRobb was looking at her anxiously. \"Past time,\" she said. \"Winterfell may have need of all its swords \\nsoon, and they had best not be made of wood.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, \"My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes \\nyours a great debt.\" \\nMaester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. \"All we have is conjecture. \\nThis is the queen\\'s beloved brother we mean to accuse. She will not take it kindly. We must have proof, \\nor forever keep silent.\" \\n\"Your proof is in the dagger,\" Ser Rodrik said. \"A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.\" \\nThere was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized. \"Someone must go to King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"I\\'ll go,\" Robb said. \\n\"No,\" she told him. \"Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell.\" She looked at Ser \\nRodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and \\ndark and impetuous. Who to send? Who would be believed? Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push \\nback the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone. She climbed out of bed. \"I must \\ngo myself.\" \\n\"My lady,\" said Maester Luwin, \"is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with \\nsuspicion.\" \\n\"What about Bran?\" Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. \"You can\\'t mean to leave \\nhim.\" \\nPage 90\\n\\n\"I have done everything I can for Bran,\" she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. \"His life is in the \\nhands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to \\nthink of now.\" \\n\"You will need a strong escort, my lady,\" Theon said. \\n\"I\\'ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,\" Robb said. \\n\"No,\" Catelyn said. \"A large party attracts unwelcome attention. I would not have the Lannisters know I \\nam coming.\" \\nSer Rodrik protested. \"My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad can be perilous for a \\nwoman alone.\" \\n\"I will not be taking the kingsroad,\" Catelyn replied. She thought for a moment, then nodded her \\nconsent. \"Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by \\nwagons \\nand wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to \\nthe sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to King\\'s \\nLanding well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters.\" And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see. \\nSANSA \\nEddard Stark had left before dawn, Septa Mordane informed Sansa as they broke their fast. \"The king \\nsent for him. Another hunt, I do believe. There are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.\" \\n\"I\\'ve never seen an aurochs,\" Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady under the table. The direwolf \\ntook it from her hand, as delicate as a queen. \\nSepta Mordane sniffed in disapproval. \"A noble lady does not feed dogs at her table,\" she said, breaking \\noff another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down onto her bread. \\n\"She\\'s not a dog, she\\'s a direwolf,\" Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her fingers with a rough tongue. \\n\"Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if we want.\" \\nThe septa was not appeased. \"You\\'re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it comes to that creature \\nyou\\'re as willful as your sister Arya.\" She scowled. \"And where is Arya this morning?\" \\n\"She wasn\\'t hungry,\" Sansa said, knowing full well that her sister had probably stolen down to the \\nkitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of some cook\\'s boy. \\n\"Do remind her to dress nicely today. The grey velvet, perhaps. We are all invited to ride with the queen \\nand Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and we must look our best.\" \\nPage 91\\n\\nSansa already looked her best. She had brushed out her long auburn hair until it shone, and picked her \\nnicest blue silks. She had been looking forward to today for more than a week. It was a great honor to \\nride with the queen, and besides, Prince Joffrey might be there. Her betrothed. Just thinking it made her \\nfeel a strange fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. Sansa did not \\nreally know Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him. He was all she ever dreamt her prince \\nshould be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. She treasured every chance to spend time \\nwith him, few as they were. The only thing that scared her about today was Arya. Arya had a way of \\nruining everything. You never knew what she would do. \"I\\'ll tell her,\" Sansa said uncertainly, \"but she\\'ll \\ndress the way she always does.\" She hoped it wouldn\\'t be too embarrassing. \"May I be excused?\" \\n\"You may.\" Septa Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and Sansa slid from the bench. \\nLady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn\\'s common room. \\nOutside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of wooden wheels as the \\nmen broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the wagons for another day\\'s march. The inn was a \\nsprawling three-story structure of pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had \\naccommodations for less than a third of the king\\'s party, which had swollen to more than four hundred \\nwith the addition of her father\\'s household and the freeriders who had joined them on the road. \\nShe found Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while she brushed dried mud \\nfrom her fur. The direwolf was not enjoying the process. Arya was wearing the same riding leathers she \\nhad worn yesterday and the day before. \\n\"You better put on something pretty,\" Sansa told her. \"Septa Mordane said so. We\\'re traveling in the \\nqueen\\'s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.\" \\n\"I\\'m not,\" Arya said, trying to brush a tangle out of Nymeria\\'s matted grey fur. \"Mycah and I are going to \\nride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.\" \\n\"Rubies,\" Sansa said, lost. \"What rubies?\" \\nArya gave her a look like she was so stupid. \"Rhaegar\\'s rubies. This is where King Robert killed him and \\nwon the crown.\" \\nSansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. \"You can\\'t look for rubies, the princess is expecting \\nus. The queen invited us both.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care,\" Arya said. \"The wheelhouse doesn\\'t even have windows, you can\\'t see a thing.\" \\n\"What could you want to see?\" Sansa said, annoyed. She had been thrilled by the invitation, and her \\nstupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she\\'d feared. \"It\\'s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.\" \\n\"It is not,\" Arya said stubbornly. \"If you came with us sometimes, you\\'d see.\" \\n\"I hate riding,\" Sansa said fervently. \"All it does is get you soiled and dusty and sore.\" \\nArya shrugged. \"Hold still, \" she snapped at Nymeria, \"I\\'m not hurting you.\" Then to Sansa she said, \\n\"When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed \\nme a lizard-lion.\" \\nPage 92\\n\\nSansa shuddered. They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling down a crooked causeway \\nthrough an endless black bog, and she had hated every moment of it. The air had been damp and \\nclammy, the causeway so narrow they could not even make proper camp at night, they had to stop right \\non the kingsroad. Dense thickets of halfdrowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping \\nwith curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools of stagnant water, \\nbut if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck them, there were quicksands waiting to \\nsuck you down, and snakes watching from the trees, and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the \\nwater, like black logs with eyes and teeth. \\nNone of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her horsey grin, her hair all \\ntangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy bunch of purple and green flowers for \\nFather. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was \\nsupposed to be, but he never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her \\nworse. \\nThen it turned out the purple flowers were called poison kisses, and Arya got a rash on her arms. Sansa \\nwould have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but Arya laughed about it, and the next day she \\nrubbed mud all over her arms like some ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it \\nwould stop the itching. She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded \\ngreen-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for sleep. How she had \\ngotten those only the seven gods knew. \\nArya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria\\'s tangles and chattering about things she\\'d seen on the trek \\nsouth. \"Last week we found this haunted watchtower, and the day before we chased a herd of wild \\nhorses. You should have seen them run when they caught a scent of \\nNymeria.\" The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya scolded her. \"Stop that, I have to do the other side, \\nyou\\'re all muddy.\" \\n\"You\\'re not supposed to leave the column,\" Sansa reminded her. \"Father said so.\" \\nArya shrugged. \"I didn\\'t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole time. I don\\'t always go off, \\neither. Sometimes it\\'s fun just to ride along with the wagons and talk to people.\" \\nSansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and grooms and serving girls, old \\nmen and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with \\nanybody. This Mycah was the worst; a butcher\\'s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and \\nsmelled of the slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but Arya \\nseemed to prefer his company to hers. \\nSansa was running out of patience now. \"You have to come with me,\" she told her sister firmly. \"You \\ncan\\'t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you.\" \\nArya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and spun away, affronted. \\n\"Come back here!\" \\n\"There\\'s going to be lemon cakes and tea,\" Sansa went on, all adult and reasonable. Lady brushed \\nagainst her leg. Sansa scratched her ears the way she liked, and Lady sat beside her on her haunches, \\nPage 93\\n\\nwatching Arya chase Nymeria. \"Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and \\nsweaty when you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?\" \\n\"I don\\'t like the queen,\" Arya said casually. Sansa sucked in her breath, shocked that even Arya would \\nsay such a thing, but her sister prattled on, heedless. \"She won\\'t even let me bring Nymeria.\" She thrust \\nthe brush under her belt and stalked her wolf. Nymeria watched her approach warily. \\n\"A royal wheelhouse is no place for a wolf,\" Sansa said. \"And Princess Myrcella is afraid of them, you \\nknow that.\" \\n\"Myrcella is a little baby.\" Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the moment she pulled out the \\nbrush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush. \"Bad \\nwolf!\" she shouted. \\nSansa couldn\\'t help but smile a little. The kennelmaster once told her that an animal takes after its master. \\nShe gave Lady a quick little hug. Lady licked her cheek. Sansa giggled. Arya heard and whirled around, \\nglaring. \"I don\\'t care what you say, I\\'m going out riding.\" Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that \\nmeant she was going to do something willful. \\n\"Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a child,\" Sansa said. \"I\\'ll go by myself then. It will be \\never so much nicer that way. Lady and I will eat all the lemon cakes and just have the best time without \\nyou.\" \\nShe turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after her, \"They won\\'t let you bring Lady either.\" She was gone \\nbefore Sansa could think of a reply, chasing Nymeria along the river. \\nAlone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she knew Septa Mordane would \\nbe waiting. Lady padded quietly by her side. She was almost in tears. All she wanted was for things to be \\nnice and pretty, the way they were in the songs. Why couldn\\'t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like \\nPrincess Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that. \\nSansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, could be so different. It \\nwould have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half brother Jon. She even looked like Jon, \\nwith the long face and brown hair of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her \\ncoloring. And Jon\\'s mother had been common, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, \\nSansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn\\'t been some mistake. Perhaps the grumkins had \\nstolen her real sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, Arya was her daughter and Sansa\\'s \\ntrueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she \\nsupposed it had to be true. \\nAs she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. A crowd had gathered around the \\nqueen\\'s wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing like a hive of bees. The doors had been thrown \\nopen, she saw, and the queen stood at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. She heard \\nher saying, \"The council does us great honor, my good lords.\" \\n\"What\\'s happening?\" she asked a squire she knew. \\n\"The council sent riders from King\\'s Landing to escort us the rest of the way,\" he told her. \"An honor \\nguard for the king.\" \\nPage 94\\n\\nAnxious to see, Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd. People moved aside hastily for the \\ndirewolf. When she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling before the queen, in armor so fine and \\ngorgeous that it made her blink. \\nOne knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales, brilliant as a field of new-fallen snow, with \\nsilver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. When he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an \\nold man with hair as pale as his armor, yet he seemed strong and \\ngraceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the pure white cloak of the Kingsguard. \\nHis companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep forest-green. He was the \\nhandsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to \\nhis shoulders and framed a clean-shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled \\nunder one arm was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold. \\nAt first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did not kneel with the others. He stood to one side, \\nbeside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked \\nand beardless, with deepset eyes and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of \\nhair remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a woman\\'s. His armor \\nwas iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard \\nuse. Above his right shoulder the stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a \\ntwo-handed greatsword, too long to be worn at his side. \\n\"The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he returns,\" the queen was \\nsaying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa could not take her eyes off the third man. He \\nseemed to feel the weight of her gaze. Slowly he turned his head. Lady growled. A terror as \\noverwhelming as anything Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. She stepped backward and \\nbumped into someone. \\nStrong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it was her father, but when \\nshe turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible \\nmockery of a smile. \"You are shaking, girl,\" he said, his voice rasping. \"Do I frighten you so much?\" \\nHe did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of his face, though it seemed \\nto her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the \\nHound laughed, and Lady moved between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to \\nwrap her arms around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on her, \\nand here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter. \\n\"A wolf,\" a man said, and someone else said, \"Seven hells, that\\'s a direwolf,\" and the first man said, \\n\"What\\'s it doing in camp?\" and the Hound\\'s rasping voice replied, \"The Starks use them for wet nurses,\" \\nand Sansa realized that the two stranger knights were looking down on \\nher and Lady, swords in their hands, and then she was frightened again, and ashamed. Tears filled her \\neyes. \\nPage 95\\n\\nShe heard the queen say, \"Joffrey, go to her.\" \\nAnd her prince was there. \\n\"Leave her alone,\" Joffrey said. He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and black leather, his golden \\ncurls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave her his hand, drew her to her feet. \"What is it, sweet lady? \\nWhy are you afraid? No one will hurt you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet, \\nthat\\'s all.\" He looked at Sandor Clegane. \"And you, dog, away with you, you\\'re scaring my betrothed.\" \\nThe Hound, ever faithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press. Sansa struggled to steady \\nherself. She felt like such a fool. She was a Stark of Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be \\na queen. \"It was not him, my sweet prince,\" she tried to explain. \"It was the other one.\" \\nThe two stranger knights exchanged a look. \"Payne?\" chuckled the young man in the green armor. \\nThe older man in white spoke to Sansa gently. \"Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me as well, sweet lady. He \\nhas a fearsome aspect.\" \\n\"As well he should.\" The queen had descended from the wheelhouse. The spectators parted to make \\nway for her. \"If the wicked do not fear the Mng\\'s Justice, you have put the wrong man in the office.\" \\nSansa finally found her words. \"Then surely you have chosen the right one, Your Grace,\" she said, and a \\ngale of laughter erupted all around her. \\n\"Well spoken, child,\" said the old man in white. \"As befits the daughter of Eddard Stark. I am honored \\nto know you, however irregular the manner of our meeting. I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the \\nKingsguard.\" He bowed. \\nSansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught her over the years came \\nback to her. \"The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,\" she said, \"and councillor to Robert our king and \\nto Aerys Targaryen before him. The honor is mine, good knight. Even in the far north, the singers praise \\nthe deeds of Barristan the Bold.\" \\nThe green knight laughed again. \"Barristan the Old, you mean. Don\\'t flatter him too sweetly, child, he \\nthinks overmuch of himself already.\" He smiled at her. \"Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as \\nwell, then I must concede that you are truly our Hand\\'s daughter.\" \\nJoffrey stiffened beside her. \"Have a care how you address my betrothed.\" \\ncan answer,\" Sansa said quickly, to quell her prince\\'s anger. She smiled at the green knight. \"Your \\nhelmet bears golden antlers, my lord. The stag is the sigil of the royal House. King Robert has two \\nbrothers. By your extreme youth, you can only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm\\'s End and councillor \\nto the king, and so I name you.\" \\nSer Barristan chuckled. \"By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing jackanapes, and so I name \\nhim.\" \\nThere was general laughter, led by Lord Renly himself. The tension of a few moments ago was gone, \\nand Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable . . . until Ser Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside, and \\nPage 96\\n\\nstood before her, unsmiling. He did not say a word. Lady bared her teeth and began to growl, a low \\nrumble full of menace, but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. \"I am sorry if I \\noffended you, Ser Ilyn,\" she said. \\nShe waited for an answer, but none came. As the headsman looked at her, his pale colorless eyes \\nseemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, leaving her soul naked before him. Still \\nsilent, he turned and walked away. \\nSansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. \"Did I say something wrong, Your Grace? Why will \\nhe not speak to me?\" \\n\"Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,\" Lord Renly commented with a sly \\nsmile. \\nJoffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa\\'s hands in his own. \"Aerys Targaryen had \\nhis tongue ripped out with hot pincers.\" \\n\"He speaks most eloquently with his sword, however,\" the queen said, \"and his devotion to our realm is \\nunquestioned.\" Then she smiled graciously and said, \"Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak \\ntogether until the king returns with your father. I fear we shall have to postpone your day with Myrcella. \\nPlease give your sweet sister my apologies. Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to entertain our \\nguest today.\" \\n\"It would be my pleasure, Mother,\" Joffrey said very formally. He took her by the arm and led her away \\nfrom the wheelhouse, and Sansa\\'s spirits took flight. A whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey \\nworshipfully. He was so gallant, she thought. The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound, \\nwhy, it was almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess Daeryssa \\nfrom the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen Naerys\\'s honor against evil Ser \\nMorgil\\'s slanders. \\nThe touch of Joffrey\\'s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. \"What would you like to do?\" \\nBe with you, Sansa thought, but she said, \"Whatever you\\'d like to do, my prince.\" \\nJofftey reflected a moment. \"We could go riding.\" \\n\"Oh, I love riding,\" Sansa said. \\nJoffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at their heels. \"Your wolf is liable to frighten the \\nhorses, and my dog seems to frighten you. Let us leave them both behind and set off on our own, what \\ndo you say?\" \\nSansa hesitated. \"If you like,\" she said uncertainly. \"I suppose I could tie Lady up.\" She did not quite \\nunderstand, though. \"I didn\\'t know you had a dog . . .\" \\nJoffrey laughed. \"He\\'s my mother\\'s dog, in truth. She has set him to guard me, and so he does.\" \\n\"You mean the Hound,\" she said. She wanted to hit herself for being so slow. Her prince would never \\nlove her if she seemed stupid. \"Is it safe to leave him behind?\" \\nPage 97\\n\\nPrince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask. \"Have no fear, lady. I am almost a man grown, \\nand I don\\'t fight with wood like your brothers. All I need is this.\" He drew his sword and showed it to \\nher; a longsword adroitly shrunken to suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and \\ndouble-edged, with a leather grip and a lion\\'s-head pommel in gold. Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly, \\nand Joffrey looked pleased. \"I call it Lion\\'s Tooth,\" he said. \\nAnd so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they ranged east along the north \\nbank of the Trident with no company save Lion\\'s Tooth. \\nIt was a glorious day, a magical day. The air was warm and heavy with the scent of flowers, and the \\nwoods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen in the north. Prince Joffrey\\'s mount was a \\nblood bay courser, swift as the wind, and he rode it with reckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was \\nhard-pressed to keep up on her mare. It was a day for adventures. They explored the caves by the \\nriverbank, and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, Joffrey found a holdfast by its \\nsmoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his lady. They dined on trout fresh from \\nthe river, and Sansa drank more wine than she had ever drunk before. \"My father only lets us have one \\ncup, and only at feasts,\" she confessed to her prince. \\n\"My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,\" Joffrey said, refilling her cup. \\nThey went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as \\nthey rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine. \"Shouldn\\'t we be \\nstarting back?\" she asked. \\n\"Soon,\" Joffrey said. \"The battleground is right up ahead, where the river bends. That was where my \\nfather killed Rhaegar Targaryen, you know. He smashed in his chest, crunch, right through the armor.\" \\nJoffrey swung an imaginary warhammer to show her how it was done. \"Then my uncle Jaime killed old \\nAerys, and my father was king. What\\'s that sound?\" \\nSansa heard it too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, snack snack snack. \"I don\\'t \\nknow,\" she said. It made her nervous, though. \"Joffrey, let\\'s go back.\" \\n\"I want to see what it is.\" Joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the sounds, and Sansa had no choice \\nbut to follow. The noises grew louder and more distinct, the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew \\ncloser they heard heavy breathing as well, and now and then a grunt. \\n\"Someone\\'s there,\" Sansa said anxiously. She found herself thinking of Lady, wishing the direwolf was \\nwith her. \\n\"You\\'re safe with me.\" Joffrey drew his Lion\\'s Tooth from its sheath. The sound of steel on leather made \\nher tremble. \"This way,\" he said, riding through a stand of trees. \\nBeyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and a girl playing at knights. Their \\nswords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look of them, and they were rushing across the \\ngrass, swinging at each other lustily. The boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and he \\nwas pressing the attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to get her \\nstick in the way of most of the boy\\'s blows, but not all. When she tried to lunge at him, he caught her \\nPage 98\\n\\nstick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood down hard on her fingers. She cried out and lost her \\nweapon. \\nPrince Joffrey laughed. The boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and dropped his stick in the \\ngrass. The girl glared at them, sucking on her knuckles to take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified. \\n\\'Arya?\" she called out incredulously. \\n\"Go away,\" Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. \"What are you doing here? Leave us \\nalone.\" \\nJoffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again. \"Your sister?\" She nodded, blushing. Joffrey \\nexamined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckled face and thick red hair. \"And who are you, \\nboy?\" he asked in a commanding tone that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior. \\n\"Mycah,\" the boy muttered. He recognized the prince and averted his eyes. \"M\\'Iord.\" \\n\"He\\'s the butcher\\'s boy,\" Sansa said. \\n\"He\\'s my friend,\" Arya said sharply. \"You leave him alone.\" \\n\"A butcher\\'s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?\" Joffrey swung down from his mount, sword in hand. \\n\"Pick up your sword, butcher\\'s boy,\" he said, his eyes bright with amusement. \"Let us see how good you \\nare.\" \\nMycah stood there, frozen with fear. \\nJoffrey walked toward him. \"Go on, pick it up. Or do you only fight little girls?\" \\n\"She ast me to, m\\'lord,\" Mycah said. \"She ast me to.\" \\nSansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on her sister\\'s face to know the boy was telling the \\ntruth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen. The wine had made him wild. \"Are you going to pick up your \\nsword?\" \\nMycah shook his head. \"It\\'s only a stick, m\\'lord. It\\'s not no sword, it\\'s only a stick.\" \\n\"And you\\'re only a butcher\\'s boy, and no knight.\" Joffrey lifted Lion\\'s Tooth and laid its point on \\nMycah\\'s cheek below the eye, as the butcher\\'s boy stood trembling. \"That was my lady\\'s sister you were \\nhitting, do you know that?\" A bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah\\'s \\nflesh, and a slow red line trickled down the boy\\'s cheek. \\n\"Stop it!\" Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick. \\nSansa was afraid. \"Arya, you stay out of this.\" \\n\"I won\\'t hurt him . . . much,\" Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes off the butcher\\'s boy. \\nArya went for him. \\nPage 99\\n\\nSansa slid off her mare, but she was too slow. Arya swung with both hands. There was a loud crack as \\nthe wood split against the back of the prince\\'s head, and then everything happened at once before \\nSansa\\'s horrified eyes. Joffrey staggered and whirled around, roaring curses. Mycah ran for the trees as \\nfast as his legs would take him. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the blow on \\nLion\\'s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. The back of his head was all bloody and \\nhis eyes were on fire. Sansa was shrieking, \"No, no, stop it, stop it, both of you, you\\'re spoiling it,\" but no \\none was listening. Arya scooped up a rock and hurled it at Joffrey\\'s head. She hit his horse instead, and \\nthe blood bay reared and went galloping off after Mycah. \"Stop it, don\\'t, stop it!\" Sansa screamed. \\nJoffrey slashed at Arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy words. Arya darted \\nback, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding \\nher toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. Sansa didn\\'t know what to do. She watched \\nhelplessly, almost blind from her tears. \\nThen a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, jaws closing around \\nJofftey\\'s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in \\nthe grass, the wolf snarling and ripping at him, the prince shrieking in pain. \"Get it off,\" he screamed. \"Get \\nit off!\" \\nArya\\'s voice cracked like a whip. \"Nymefia!\" \\nThe direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya\\'s side. The prince lay in the grass, whimpering, \\ncradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya said, \"She didn\\'t hurt you . . . much.\" She \\npicked up Lion\\'s Tooth where it had fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands. \\nJofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. \"No,\" he said, \"don\\'t hurt me. I\\'ll tell my \\nmother.\" \\n\"You leave him alone!\" Sansa screamed at her sister. \\nArya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into the throw. The blue steel \\nflashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It hit the water and vanished with a splash. Joffrey \\nmoaned. Arya ran off to her horse, Nymeria loping at her heels. \\nAfter they had gone, Sansa went to Prince Joffrey. His eyes were closed in pain, his breath ragged. \\nSansa knelt beside him. \"Joffrey,\" she sobbed. \"Oh, look what they did, look what they did. My poor \\nprince. Don\\'t be afraid. I\\'ll ride to the holdfast and bring help for you.\" Tenderly she reached out and \\nbrushed back his soft blond hair. \\nHis eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing there, nothing but the vilest \\ncontempt. \"Then go,\" he spit at her. \"And don\\'t touch me.\" \\nEDDARD \\nThey\\'ve found her, my lord.\" \\nNed rose quickly. \"Our men or Lannister\\'s?\" \\nPage 100\\n\\n\"T\"It was Jory,\" his steward Vayon Poole replied. \"She\\'s not been harmed.\" \\n\"Thank the gods,\" Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four days now, but the queen\\'s \\nmen had been out hunting as well. \"Where is she? Tell Jory to bring her here at once.\" \\n\"I am sorry, my lord,\" Poole told him. \"The guards on the gate were Lannister men, and they informed \\nthe queen when Jory brought her in. She\\'s being taken directly before the king . . .\" \\n\"Damn that woman!\" Ned said, striding to the door. \"Find Sansa and bring her to the audience chamber. \\nHer voice may be needed.\" He descended the tower steps in a red rage. He had led searches himself for \\nthe first three days, and had scarcely slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had \\nbeen so heartsick and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with \\nstrength. \\nMen called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in his haste. He would have \\nrun, but he was still the King\\'s Hand, and a Hand must keep his dignity. He was aware of the eyes that \\nfollowed him, of the muttered voices wondering what he would do. \\nThe castle was a modest holding a half day\\'s ride south of the Trident. The royal party had made \\nthemselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun Darry, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher\\'s \\nboy was conducted on both sides of the river. They were not welcome visitors. Ser Raymun lived under \\nthe king\\'s peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar\\'s dragon banners at the Trident, and his three \\nolder brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun had forgotten. With king\\'s men, \\nDarry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions \\nburned hot and heavy. \\nThe king had appropriated Ser Raymun\\'s audience chamber, and that was where Ned found them. The \\nroom was crowded when he burst in. Too crowded, he thought; left alone, he and Robert might have \\nbeen able to settle the matter amicably. \\nRobert was slumped in Darry\\'s high seat at the far end of the room, his face closed and sullen. Cersei \\nLannister and her son stood beside him. The queen had her hand on Joffrey\\'s shoulder. Thick silken \\nbandages still covered the boy\\'s arm. \\nArya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye upon her. \"Arya,\" Ned called \\nloudly. He went to her, his boots ringing on the stone floor. When she saw him, she cried out and began \\nto sob. \\nNed went to one knee and took her in his arms. She was shaking. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she sobbed, \"I\\'m sorry, \\nI\\'m sorry.\" \\n\"I know,\" he said. She felt so tiny in his arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. It was hard to see how she \\nhad caused so much trouble. \"Are you hurt?\" \\n\"No.\" Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. \"Hungry some. I ate some \\nberries, but there was nothing else.\" \\n\"We\\'ll feed you soon enough,\" Ned promised. He rose to face the king. \"What is the meaning of this?\" \\nPage 101\\n\\nHis eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. But for his own men, they were few enough. Ser \\nRaymun Darry guarded his look well. Lord Renly wore a half smile that might mean anything, and old Ser \\nBarristan was grave; the rest were Lannister men, and hostile. Their only good fortune was that both \\nJaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing, leading searches north of the Trident. \"Why was I not \\ntold that my daughter had been found?\" Ned demanded, his voice ringing. \"Why was she not brought to \\nme at once?\" \\nHe spoke to Robert, but it was Cersei Lannister who answered. \"How dare you speak to your king in \\nthat manner!\" \\nAt that, the king stirred. \"Quiet, woman,\" he snapped. He straightened \\nin his seat. \"I am sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. It seemed best to bring her here and \\nget the business done with quickly.\" \\n\"And what business is that?\" Ned put ice in his voice. \\nThe queen stepped forward. \"You know full well, Stark. This girl of yours attacked my son. Her and her \\nbutcher\\'s boy. That animal of hers tried to tear his arm off.\" \\n\"That\\'s not true,\" Arya said loudly. \"She just bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.\" \\n\"Joff told us what happened,\" the queen said. \"You and the butcher boy beat him with clubs while you \\nset your wolf on him.\" \\n\"That\\'s not how it was,\" Arya said, close to tears again. Ned put a hand on her shoulder. \\n\"Yes it is!\" Prince Joffrey insisted. \"They all attacked me, and she threw Lion\\'s Tooth in the river!\" Ned \\nnoticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as he spoke. \\n\"Liar!\" Arya yelled. \\n\"Shut up!\" the prince yelled back. \\n\"Enough!\" the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. Silence fell. He glowered at \\nArya through his thick beard. \"Now, child, you will tell me what happened. Tell it all, and tell it true. It is \\na great crime to lie to a king.\" Then he looked over at his son. \"When she is done, you will have your \\nturn. Until then, hold your tongue.\" \\nAs Arya began her story, Ned heard the door open behind him. He glanced back and saw Vayon Poole \\nenter with Sansa. They stood quietly at the back of the hall as Arya spoke. When she got to the part \\nwhere she threw Joffrey\\'s sword into the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king \\nbristled. \"Ser Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.\" \\nLord Renly stifled his laughter. \"My brother is too kind. I can find the door myself.\" He bowed to \\nJoffrey. \"Perchance later you\\'ll tell me how a nine-year-old girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm \\nyou with a broom handle and throw your sword in the river.\" As the door swung shut behind him, Ned \\nheard him say, \"Lion\\'s Tooth,\" and guffaw once more. \\nPage 102\\n\\nPrince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. When his son was done talking, \\nthe king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man who wanted to be anywhere but here. \"What in all \\nthe seven hells am I supposed to make of this? He says one thing, she says another.\" \\n\"They were not the only ones present,\" Ned said. \"Sansa, come \\nhere.\" Ned had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. \"Tell us \\nwhat happened.\" \\nHis eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She was dressed in blue velvets trimmed with white, a \\nsilver chain around her neck. Her thick auburn hair had been brushed until it shone. She blinked at her \\nsister, then at the young prince. \"I don\\'t know,\" she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. \"I \\ndon\\'t remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn\\'t see . . .\" \\n\"You rotten!\" Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking Sansa down to the ground, \\npummeling her. \"Liar, liar, liar, liar.\" \\n\"Arya, stop it!\" Ned shouted. Jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. Sansa was pale and shaking as Ned \\nlifted her back to her feet. \"Are you hurt?\" he asked, but she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem \\nto hear. \\n\"The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,\" Cersei Lannister said. \"Robert, I want her punished.\" \\n\"Seven hells,\" Robert swore. \"Cersei, look at her. She\\'s a child. What would you have me do, whip her \\nthrough the streets? Damn it, children fight. It\\'s over. No lasting harm was done.\" \\nThe queen was furious. \"Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life.\" \\nRobert Baratheon looked at his eldest son. \"So he will. Perhaps they will teach him a lesson. Ned, see \\nthat your daughter is disciplined. I will do the same with my son.\" \\n\"Gladly, Your Grace,\" Ned said with vast relief. \\nRobert started to walk away, but the queen was not done. \"And what of the direwolf?\" she called after \\nhim. \"What of the beast that savaged your son?\" \\nThe king stopped, turned back, frowned. \"I\\'d forgotten about the damned wolf.\" \\nNed could see Arya tense in Jory\\'s arms. Jory spoke up quickly. \"We found no trace of the direwolf, \\nYour Grace.\" \\nRobert did not look unhappy. \"No? So be it.\" \\nThe queen raised her voice. \"A hundred golden dragons to the man who brings me its skin!\" \\n\"A costly pelt,\" Robert grumbled. \"I want no part of this, woman. You can damn well buy your furs with \\nLannister gold.\" \\nThe queen regarded him coolly. \"I had not thought you so niggardly. The king I\\'d thought to wed would \\nPage 103\\n\\nhave laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went down.\" \\nRobert\\'s face darkened with anger. \"That would be a fine trick, without a wolf.\" \\n\"We have a wolf,\" Cersei Lannister said. Her voice was very quiet, but her green eyes shone with \\ntriumph. \\nIt took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the king shrugged irritably. \"As \\nyou will. Have Ser Ilyn see to it.\" \\n\"Robert, you cannot mean this,\" Ned protested. \\nThe king was in no mood for more argument. \"Enough, Ned, I will hear no more. A direwolf is a savage \\nbeast. Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl the same way the other did on my son. Get her a \\ndog, she\\'ll be happier for it.\" \\nThat was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend. Her eyes were frightened as they went to her \\nfather. \"He doesn\\'t mean Lady, does he?\" She saw the truth on his face. \"No,\" she said. \"No, not Lady, \\nLady didn\\'t bite anybody, she\\'s good . . .\" \\n\"Lady wasn\\'t there,\" Arya shouted angrily. \"You leave her alone!\" \\n\"Stop them,\" Sansa pleaded, \"don\\'t let them do it, please, please, it wasn\\'t Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya \\ndid it, you can\\'t, it wasn\\'t Lady, don\\'t let them hurt Lady, I\\'ll make her be good, I promise, I promise . . .\" \\nShe started to cry. \\nAll Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept. He looked across the room at \\nRobert. His old friend, closer than any brother. \"Please, Robert. For the love you bear me. For the love \\nyou bore my sister. Please.\" \\nThe king looked at them for a long moment, then turned his eyes on his wife. \"Damn you, Cersei,\" he \\nsaid with loathing. \\nNed stood, gently disengaging himself from Sansa\\'s grasp. All the weariness of the past four days had \\nreturned to him. \"Do it yourself then, Robert,\" he said in a voice cold and sharp as steel. \"At least have \\nthe courage to do it yourself.\" \\nRobert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, his footsteps heavy as lead. Silence \\nfilled the hall. \\n\"Where is the direwolf?\" Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone. Beside her, Prince Joffrey \\nwas smiling. \\n\"The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, Your Grace,\" Ser Barristan Selmy answered reluctantly. \\n\"Send for Ilyn Payne.\" \\n\"No,\" Ned said. \"Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice.\" The words tasted of bile in \\nhis throat, but he forced them out. \"If it must be done, I will do it.\" \\nPage 104\\n\\nCersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously. \"You, Stark? Is this some trick? Why would you do such a \\nthing?\" \\nThey were all staring at him, but it was Sansa\\'s look that cut. \"She is of the north. She deserves better \\nthan a butcher.\" \\nHe left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter\\'s wails echoing in his ears, and found the direwolf \\npup where they chained her. Ned sat beside her for a while. \"Lady,\" he said, tasting the name. He had \\nnever paid much attention to the names the children had picked, but looking at her now, he knew that \\nSansa had chosen well. She was the smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and trusting. She \\nlooked at him with bright golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey fur. \\nShortly, Jory brought him Ice. \\nWhen it was over, he said, \"Choose four men and have them take the body north. Bury her at \\nWinterfell.\" \\n\"All that way?\" Jory said, astonished. \\n\"All that way,\" Ned affirmed. \"The Lannister woman shall never have this skin.\" \\nHe was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when Sandor Clegane and his riders \\ncame pounding through the castle gate, back from their hunt. \\nThere was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape wrapped in a bloody cloak. \"No \\nsign of your daughter, Hand,\" the Hound rasped down, \"but the day was not wholly wasted. We got her \\nlittle pet.\" He reached back and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned. \\nBending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find for Arya, but it was not \\nNymeria after all. It was the butcher\\'s boy, Mycah, his body covered in dried blood. He had been cut \\nalmost in half from shoulder to waist by some terrible blow struck from above. \\n\"You rode him down,\" Ned said. \\nThe Hound\\'s eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dog\\'s-head helm. \"He ran.\" He \\nlooked at Ned\\'s face and laughed. \"But not very fast.\" \\nBRAN \\nIt seemed as though he had been falling for years. \\nFly, a voice whispered in the darkness, but Bran did not know \\'thow to fly, so all he could do was fall. \\nMaester Luwin made a little boy of clay, baked him till he was hard and brittle, dressed him in Bran\\'s \\nclothes, and flung him off a roof. Bran remembered the way he shattered. \"But I never fall,\" he said, \\nfalling. \\nPage 105\\n\\nThe ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey mists that whirled around \\nhim, but he could feel how fast he was falling, and he knew what was waiting for him down there. Even in \\ndreams, you could not fall forever. He would wake up in the instant before he hit the ground, he knew. \\nYou always woke up in the instant before you hit the ground. \\nAnd if you don\\'t? the voice asked. \\nThe ground was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles away, but closer than it had been. It was \\ncold here in the darkness. There was no sun, no stars, only the ground below coming up to smash him, \\nand the grey mists, and the whispering voice. He wanted to cry. \\nNot cry. Fly. \\n\"I can\\'t fly,\" Bran said. \"I can\\'t, I can\\'t \\nHow do you know? Have you ever tried? \\nThe voice was high and thin. Bran looked around to see where it \\nwas coming from. A crow was spiraling down with him, just out of reach, following him as he fell. \"Help \\nme,\" he said. \\nI\\'m trying, the crow replied. Say, got any corn? \\nBran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him. When he pulled his hand out, \\ngolden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air. They fell with him. \\nThe crow landed on his hand and began to eat. \\n\"Are you really a crow?\" Bran asked. \\nAre you really falling? the crow asked back. \\n\"It\\'s just a dream,\" Bran said. \\nIs it? asked the crow. \\n\"I\\'ll wake up when I hit the ground,\" Bran told the bird. \\nYou\\'ll die when you hit the ground, the crow said. It went back to eating corn. \\nBran looked down. He could see mountains now, their peaks white with snow, and the silver thread of \\nrivers in dark woods. He closed his eyes and began to cry. \\nThat won\\'t do any good, the crow said. I told you, the answer is flying, not crying. How hard can it be? \\nI\\'m doing it. The crow took to the air and flapped around Bran\\'s hand. \\n\"You have wings,\" Bran pointed out. \\nPage 106\\n\\nMaybe you do too. \\nBran felt along his shoulders, groping for feathers. \\nThere are different kinds of wings, the crow said. \\nBran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched taut over bones. Had he \\nalways been so thin? He tried to remember. A face swam up at him out of the grey mist, shining with \\nlight, golden. \"The things I do for love,\" it said. \\nBran screamed. \\nThe crow took to the air, cawing. Not that, it shrieked at him. Forget that, you do not need it now, put it \\naside, put it away. It landed on Bran\\'s shoulder, and pecked at him, and the shining golden face was \\ngone. \\nBran was falling faster than ever. The grey mists howled around him as he plunged toward the earth \\nbelow. \"What are you doing to me?\" he asked the crow, tearful. \\nTeaching you how to fly. \\n\"I can\\'t fly!\" \\nYou\\'re flying tight now. \\n,,Fm falling!\" \\nEvery flight begins with a fall, the crow said. Look down. \\n\"I\\'m afraid . . .\" \\nLOOKDOWN! \\nBran looked down, and felt his insides turn to water. The ground was rushing up at him now. The whole \\nworld was spread out below him, a tapestry of white and brown and green. He could see everything so \\nclearly that for a moment he forgot to be afraid. He could see the whole realm, and everyone in it. \\nHe saw Winterfell as the eagles see it, the tall towers looking squat and stubby from above, the castle \\nwalls just lines in the dirt. He saw Maester Luwin on his balcony, studying the sky through a polished \\nbronze tube and frowning as he made notes in a book. He saw his brother Robb, taller and stronger than \\nhe remembered him, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand. He saw Hodor, the \\nsimple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to Mikken\\'s forge, hefting it onto his shoulder as easily as \\nanother man might heft a bale of hay. At the heart of the godswood, the great white weirwood brooded \\nover its reflection in the black pool, its leaves rustling in a chill wind. When it felt Bran watching, it lifted \\nits eyes from the still waters and stared back at him knowingly. \\nHe looked east, and saw a galley racing across the waters of the Bite. He saw his mother sitting alone in \\na cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and \\nPage 107\\n\\nSer Rodrik leaned across a rail, shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark \\nroaring lashed by lightning, but somehow they could not see it. \\nHe looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his father pleading with the \\nking, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching \\nin silence and holding her secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow \\nwas dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, golden and \\nbeautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but when he opened his visor, there \\nwas nothing inside but darkness and thick black blood. \\nHe lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea, to the Free Cities and the green Dothraki sea \\nand beyond, to Vaes Dothrak under its mountain, to the fabled lands of the Jade Sea, to Asshai by the \\nShadow, where dragons stirred beneath the sunrise. \\nFinally he looked north. He saw the Wall shining like blue crystal, and his bastard brother Jon sleeping \\nalone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he \\nlooked past the Wall, past endless forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great \\nblue-white rivers of ice and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he \\nlooked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into \\nthe heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat of his tears burned on his cheeks. \\nNow you know, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder. Now you know why you must live. \\n\"Why?\" Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling. \\nBecause winter is coming. \\nBran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. It had three eyes, and the third eye \\nwas full of a terrible knowledge. Bran looked down. There was nothing below him now but snow and \\ncold and death, a frozen wasteland where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him. They \\nflew up at him like spears. He saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their points. He \\nwas desperately afraid. \\n\"Can a man still be brave if he\\'s afraid?\" he heard his own voice saying, small and far away. \\nAnd his father\\'s voice replied to him. \"That is the only time a man can be brave.\" \\nNow, Bran, the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die. \\nDeath reached for him, screaming. \\nBran spread his arms and flew. \\nWings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward. The terrible needles of ice receded \\nbelow him. The sky opened up above. Bran soared. It was better than climbing. It was better than \\nanything. The world grew small beneath him. \\n\"I\\'m flying!\" he cried out in delight. \\nPage 108\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed, said the three-eyed crow. It took to the air, flapping its wings in his face, slowing him, \\nblinding him. He faltered in the air as its pinions beat against his cheeks. Its beak stabbed at him fiercely, \\nand Bran felt a sudden blinding pain in the middle of his forehead, between his eyes. \\n\"What are you doing?\" he shrieked. \\nThe crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the grey mists shuddered and \\nswirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and he saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving \\nwoman with long black hair, and he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he \\nremembered her now, and then he realized that he was in Winterfell, in a bed- high in some chilly tower \\nroom, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the floor and ran down the \\nsteps, shouting, \"He\\'s awake, he\\'s awake, he\\'s awake.\" \\nBran touched his forehead, between his eyes. The place where the \\ncrow had pecked him was still burning, but there was nothing there, no blood, no wound. He felt weak \\nand dizzy. He tried to get out of bed, but nothing happened. \\nAnd then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly on his legs. He felt nothing. \\nA pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like the sun. The window was open and it was cold in \\nthe room, but the warmth that came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath. His pup, Bran realized . . . \\nor was it? He was so big now. He reached out to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf. \\nWhen his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf \\nwas licking Bran\\'s face. Bran looked up calmly. \"His name is Summer,\" he said. \\nCATELYN \\n\"We will make King\\'s Landing within the hour.\" \\nCatelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile. \"Your oarmen have done well by us, \\nCaptain. Each one of them shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.\" \\nCaptain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow. \"You are far too generous, Lady Stark. The honor \\nof carrying a great lady like yourself is all the reward they need.\" \\n\"But they\\'ll take the silver anyway.\" \\nMoreo smiled. \"As you say.\" He spoke the Common Tongue fluently, with only the slightest hint of a \\nTyroshi accent. He\\'d been plying the narrow sea for thirty years, he\\'d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, \\nand finally captain of his own trading galleys. The Stonn Dancer was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a \\ntwo-masted galley of sixty oars. \\nShe had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when Catelyn and Ser Rodrik \\nPage 109\\n\\nCassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, \\nand Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on \\nthe galley. It was good that she had. The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and without \\nthe galley\\'s oars they\\'d still be beating their way past the \\nFingers, instead of skimming toward King\\'s Landing and journey\\'s end. \\nSo close, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed where the dagger had bitten. \\nThe pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. She could not bend the last two fingers on her left \\nhand, and the others would never again be dexterous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for \\nBran\\'s life. \\nSer Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. \"My good friend,\" said Moreo through his forked \\ngreen beard. The Tyroshi loved bright colors, even in their facial hair. \"It is so fine to see you looking \\nbetter.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Ser Rodrik agreed. \"I haven\\'t wanted to die for almost two days now.\" He bowed to Catelyn. \\n\"My lady.\" \\nHe was looking better. A shade thinner than he had been when they set out from White Harbor, but \\nalmost himself again. The strong winds in the Bite and the roughness of the narrow sea had not agreed \\nwith him, and he\\'d almost gone over the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone, \\nyet somehow he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo\\'s men could rescue him and carry him safely \\nbelow decks. \\n\"The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,\" she said. \\nSer Rodrik managed a wry smile. \"So soon?\" He looked odd without his great white side whiskers; \\nsmaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit \\nto a crewman\\'s razor, after his whiskers had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he \\nleaned over the rail and retched into the swirling winds. \\n\"I will leave you to discuss your business,\" Captain Moreo said. He bowed and took his leave of them. \\nThe galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, her oars rising and falling in perfect time. Ser Rodrik held \\nthe rail and looked out over the passing shore. \"I have not been the most valiant of protectors.\" \\nCatelyn touched his arm. \"We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that truly matters.\" Her hand \\ngroped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. The dagger was still at her side. She found she \\nhad to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. \"Now we must reach the king\\'s master-at-arms, and \\npray that he can be trusted.\" \\n\"Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one.\" Ser Rodrik\\'s hand went to his face to stroke his \\nwhiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. He looked nonplussed. \"He may know the \\nblade, \\nyes ... but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will \\nPage 110\\n\\nknow you on sight.\" \\nCatelyn\\'s mouth grew tight. \"Littlefinger,\" she murmured. His face swam up before her; a boy\\'s face, \\nthough he was a boy no longer. His father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, \\nyet still they called him Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. \\nHis family\\'s modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for \\nhis age. \\nSer Rodrik cleared his throat. \"Lord Baelish once, ah His \\nthought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word. \\nCatelyn was past delicacy. \"He was my father\\'s ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I thought of him \\nas a brother, but his feelings for me were . . . more than brotherly. When it was announced that I was to \\nwed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, \\nPetyr scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr\\'s life. He let him off with a scar. Afterward my \\nfather sent him away. I have not seen him since.\" She lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind \\ncould blow the memories away. \"He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the \\nletter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brother\\'s place.\" \\nSer Rodrik\\'s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. \"Littlefinger sits on the small council \\nnow.\" \\n\"I knew he would rise high,\" Catelyn said. \"He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be \\nclever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him.\" \\nHigh overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, \\ngiving orders, and all around them the Stonn Dancer burst into frenetic activity as King\\'s Landing slid into \\nview atop its three high hills. \\nThree hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful \\nof fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into \\nthe sea. Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put \\nashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth. \\nNow the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick \\nstorehouses and timbered inns and merchant\\'s stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one \\non another. She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings \\nwere broad roads lined with trees, \\nwandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. Visenya\\'s hill \\nwas crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of \\nRhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors \\nclosed now for a century. The Street of the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls \\nrose in the distance, high and strong. \\nA hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. Deepwater fishing boats \\nand river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading \\ngalleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys. Catelyn sp~ied the queen\\'s ornate barge, tied \\nPage 111\\n\\nup beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean \\ngolden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water. \\nAnd above it all, frowning down from Aegon\\'s high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge drum-towers \\ncrowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and \\ndungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers\\' nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. \\nAegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed. \\nAfterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on \\nit. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he \\nvowed. \\nYet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed \\ndragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon. \\nA high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with \\nwind. The Stonn Dancer moved past it, pulling steadily for shore. \\n\"My lady,\" Ser Rodrik said, \"I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not \\nenter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.\" \\nShe studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian \\nof the Free Cities. \"You would be as much at risk as I would.\" \\nSer Rodrik smiled. \"I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized \\nmyself. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe \\nI am safe enough, my lady.\" \\nMoreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the \\nriver, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the \\nhull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up, \\nall smiles. \"King\\'s Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer \\npassage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?\" \\n\"We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable \\nand not too far from the river.\" \\nThe Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. \"Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit \\nyour needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed \\nupon. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.\" \\n\"For the oarmen,\" Catelyn reminded him. \\n\"Oh, of a certainty,\" said Moreo. \"Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh. \\nFor the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away \\nor spend it all for a night\\'s pleasure.\" \\n\"There are worse things to spend money on,\" Ser Rodrik put in. \"Winter is coming.\" \\nPage 112\\n\\n\"A man must make his own choices,\" Catelyn said. \"They earned the silver. How they spend it is no \\nconcern of mine.\" \\n\"As you say, my lady,\" Moreo replied, bowing and smiling. \\nJust to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who \\ncarried their chests halfway up Visenya\\'s hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old \\nplace on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them \\nover suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large \\nand airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. \\nBest of all, she had no interest in their names. \\n\"I think it best if you stay away from the common room,\" Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in. \\n\"Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching.\" He wore ringmail, dagger, and \\nlongsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head. \"I will be back before nightfall, \\nwith Ser Aron,\" he promised. \"Rest now, my lady.\" \\nCatelyn was tired. The voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no longer as young as she had \\nbeen. Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She \\nwatched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was \\nlost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of \\nfeathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep. \\nShe woke to a pounding on her door. \\nCatelyn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of King\\'s Landing were red in the light of the \\nsetting sun. She had slept longer than she intended. A fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called \\nout, \"Open, in the name of the king.\" \\n\"A moment,\" she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger was on the bedside table. \\nShe snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door. \\nThe men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. Their \\nleader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, \"No need for that, m1ady. We\\'re to escort you to the \\ncastle.\" \\n\"By whose authority?\" she said. \\nHe showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal was a mockingbird, in grey \\nwax. \"Petyr,\" she said. So soon. Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik. She looked at the head \\nguardsman. \"Do you know who I am?\" \\n\"No, m\\'lady,\" he said. \"M\\'lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not \\nmistreated.\" \\nCatelyn nodded. \"You may wait outside while I dress.\" \\nShe bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. Her fingers were thick and awkward \\nPage 113\\n\\nas she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck. How could \\nLittlefinger have known she was here? Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he \\nwas stubborn, and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached King\\'s Landing before \\nher? No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have come to her. How . . . ? \\nThen she thought, Moreo. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. She \\nhoped he\\'d gotten a good price for the information. \\nThey had brought a horse for her. The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and Catelyn \\nfelt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks. When they \\nreached the Red Keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle \\nwindows were alive with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted \\nher through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower. \\nHe was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil \\nlamp beside him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her. \\n\"Cat,\" he said quietly. \\n\"Why have I been brought here in this fashion?\" \\nHe rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. \"Leave us.\" The men departed. \"You were not \\nmistreated, I trust,\" he said after they had gone. \"I gave firm instructions.\" He noticed her bandages. \\n\"Your hands . . .\" \\nCatelyn ignored the implied question. \"I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench,\" \\nshe said icily. \"As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.\" \\n\"I\\'ve angered you, my lady. That was never my intent.\" He looked contrite. The look brought back vivid \\nmemories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a \\ngift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a \\nsmall man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she \\nremembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads \\nof silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that \\nfastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver. \\n\"How did you know I was in the city?\" she asked him. \\n\"Lord Varys knows all,\" Petyr said with a sly smile. \"He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see \\nyou alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many years?\" \\nCatelyn ignored his familiarity. There were more important questions. \"So it was the King\\'s Spider who \\nfound me.\" \\nLittlefinger winced. \"You don\\'t want to call him that. He\\'s very sensitive. Comes of being an eunuch, I \\nimagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oftimes he knows about it before it \\nhappens. He has informants everywhere. His little birds, he calls them. One of his little birds heard about \\nyour visit. Thankfully, Varys came to me first.\" \\nPage 114\\n\\n\"Why you?\" \\nHe shrugged. \"Why not me? I am master of coin, the king\\'s own councillor. Selmy and Lord Renly rode \\nnorth to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me. I \\nwas the obvious choice. I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.\" \\n\"Does Varys know about \\n\"Lord Varys knows everything . . . except why you are here.\" He lifted an eyebrow. \"Why are you \\nhere?\" \\n\"A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her \\nno?\" \\nLittlefinger laughed. \"Oh, very good, my lady, but please don\\'t expect me to believe that. I know you too \\nwell. What were the Tully words again?\" \\nHer throat was dry. \"Family, Duty, Honor, \" she recited stiffly. He did know her too well. \\n\"Family, Duty, Honor,\" he echoed. \"All of which required you to remain in Winterfell, where our Hand \\nleft you. No, my lady, something has happened. This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. I \\nbeg of you, let me help. Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.\" There was a \\nsoft knock on the door. \"Enter,\" Littlefinger called out. \\nThe man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. He \\nwore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers \\nof soft velvet. \"Lady Stark,\" he said, taking her hand in both of his, \"to see you again after so many years \\nis such a joy.\" His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. \"Oh, your poor hands. Have \\nyou burned yourself, sweet lady? The fingers are so delicate . . . Our good Maester Pycelle makes a \\nmarvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?\" \\nCatelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. \"I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already \\nseen to my hurts.\" \\nVarys bobbed his head. \"I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him so young. The gods are \\ncruel.\" \\n\"On that we agree, Lord Varys,\" she said. The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; \\nVarys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers. \\nThe eunuch spread his soft hands. \"On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I have great esteem for your \\nhusband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.\" \\n\"Yes,\" she was forced to say. \"For a certainty.\" \\n\"Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,\" quipped Littlefinger. He smiled slyly. \"At least in \\nLord Varys\\'s hearing.\" \\n\"Good lady,\" Varys said with great solicitude. \"There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing \\nPage 115\\n\\npowers. Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.\" \\n\"Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,\" she told him. She would not speak of Bran, not \\nhere, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger only a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let \\nthem see her grief. \"Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.\" \\nVarys giggled like a little girl. \"Oh, yes. I suppose I am guilty. I hope you forgive me, kind lady.\" He \\neased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. \"I wonder if we might trouble you to show us \\nthe dagger?\" \\nCatelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an \\nenchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unless \"What have you done to Ser \\nRodrik?\" she demanded. \\nLittlefinger was lost. \"I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance. What dagger \\nare we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?\" \\n\"Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,\" Varys informed him. \"I assure you, Lady Stark, \\nnothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser \\nAron Santagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain dagger. About sunset, they left the castle \\ntogether and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the \\ncommon room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.\" \\n\"How could you know all that?\" \\n\"The whisperings of little birds,\" Varys said, smiling. \"I know things, sweet lady. That is the nature of my \\nservice.\" He shrugged. \"You do have the dagger with you, yes?\" \\nCatelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him. \"Here. \\nPerhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.\" \\nVarys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge. Blood welled, and he let \\nout a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table. \\n\"Careful,\" Catelyn told him, \"it\\'s sharp.\" \\n\"Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,\" Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and \\nlooked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. \\nHe flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. \"Such sweet balance. You want to find the \\nowner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You should have \\ncome to me.\" \\n\"And if I had,\" she said, \"what would you have told me?\" \\n\"I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King\\'s Landing.\" He grasped the blade \\nbetween thumb and forefinger, \\nPage 116\\n\\ndrew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It struck \\nthe door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. \"It\\'s mine.\" \\n\"Yours?\" It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell. \\n\"Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name day,\" he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from \\nthe wood. \"I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court.\" Petyr\\'s sheepish grin made him \\nlook half a boy again. \"When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime \\nlost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife. Her Grace got the \\nemerald back, but the winner kept the rest.\" \\n\"Who?\" Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered pain. \\n\"The Imp,\" said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. \"Tyrion Lannister.\" \\nJON \\nThe courtyard rang to the song of swords. \\nUnder black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jon\\'s chest as he pressed the \\nattack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. When he raised his sword, Jon went \\nunderneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy\\'s leg and sent him \\nstaggering. Grenn\\'s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. When he tried a \\nsideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing \\nand sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that \\nbrought a cry of pain. \\n\"Enough!\" Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel. \\nGrenn cradled his hand. \"The bastard broke my wrist.\" \\n\"The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. Or would have, if these \\nblades had an edge. It\\'s fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers.\" Ser Alliser \\ngestured at Jeren and Toad. \"Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.\" \\nJon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty morning air felt good on \\nhis face. He leaned on his \\nsword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory. \\n\"That is a longsword, not an old man\\'s cane,\" Ser Alliser said sharply. \"Are your legs hurting, Lord \\nSnow?\" \\nJon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. The \\nboys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into its scabbard. \\n\"No,\" he replied. \\nPage 117\\n\\nThorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. He was a compact man \\nof fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx. \"The truth now,\" he \\ncommanded. \\n\"I\\'m tired,\" Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel \\nhis bruises now that the fight was done. \\n\"What you are is weak.\" \\n\"I won.\" \\n\"No. The Aurochs lost.\" \\nOne of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser \\nhad sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The master-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated \\nhim, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse. \\n\"That will be all,\" Thorne told them. \"I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. If the Others \\never come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.\" \\nJon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were \\nalmost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most were two or three \\nyears his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid \\nof being hit. Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. \\nHalder\\'s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them, \\nthe more Jon despised them. \\nInside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him. \\nMethodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned \\nin iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with \\nhim here. In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm. \\nThe weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun \\nblacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his \\ncloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through \\nthe walls like blood through a man\\'s body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the \\nwalls were cold here, and the people colder. \\nNo one had told him the Night\\'s Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf \\nhad given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had \\nknown what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse. \\nEven his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen \\nStark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights \\nwith Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given \\nover to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne. \\nPage 118\\n\\nThree days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a \\nranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and \\npleaded to go with him. Benjen refused him curtly. \"This is not Winterfell,\" he told him as he cut his meat \\nwith fork and dagger. \"On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. You\\'re no ranger, Jon, only a green \\nboy with the smell of summer still on you.\" \\nStupidly, Jon argued. \"I\\'ll be fifteen on my name day,\" he said. \"Almost a man grown.\" \\nBenjen Stark frowned. \"A boy you are, and a boy you\\'ll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a \\nman of the Night\\'s Watch. If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. \\nWe put aside our old families when we swear our vows. Your father will always have a place in my \\nheart, but these are my brothers now.\" He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard \\ncold men in black. \\nJon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave. One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a \\nbawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at \\nthat, but he had no smile for his nephew. \"How often must I tell you no, Jon? We\\'ll speak when I return.\" \\nAs he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion \\nLannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind\\'s eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on \\nthe snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming? \\nAfterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur. \\nIf he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small \\nsept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were \\nreal, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter. \\nHe missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival \\nand best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join \\nin whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him \\nanything but \"my half brother\" since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. And Arya . . \\n. he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair \\nand torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had . . . yet she could \\nalways make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and \\nwatch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him. \\n\"You broke my wrist, bastard boy.\" \\nJon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three \\nof his friends behind him. He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all \\ncalled him Toad. The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, \\nrapers taken down in the Fingers. He\\'d forgotten their names. He hardly ever spoke ,to them, if he could \\nhelp it. They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them. \\nJon stood up. \"I\\'ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.\" Grenn was sixteen and a head taller \\nthan Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. He\\'d beaten every one of \\nthem in the yard. \\nPage 119\\n\\n\"Maybe we\\'ll break you,\" one of the rapers said. \\n\"Try.\" Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back. \\n\"You make us look bad,\" complained Toad. \\n\"You looked bad before I ever met you,\" Jon told him. The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, \\nhard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out. \\nToad stepped close. \"The little lordling has a mouth on him,\" he said. He had pig eyes, small and shiny. \\n\"Is that your mommy\\'s mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her \\na time or two.\" He laughed. \\nJon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him. There was a \\nsudden cry of pain, and he was free. He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed \\non his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth. \\nThe two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at \\nhim. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory. \\n\"STOP THIS! NOW!\" \\nJon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them. \"The yard is for fighting,\" the \\narmorer said. \"Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I\\'ll make them my quarrels. You won\\'t like that.\" \\nToad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came away bloody. \"He tried to \\nkill me.\" \\n\" \\'S true. I saw it,\" one of the rapers put in. \\n\"He broke my wrist,\" Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection. \\nThe armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. \"A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maestor Aemon \\nwill give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your \\ncells. Not you, Snow. You stay.\" \\nJon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the \\nsilent promises of future retribution. His arm was throbbing. \\n\"The Watch has need of every man it can get,\" Donal Noye said when they were alone. \"Even men like \\nToad. You won\\'t win any honors killing him.\" \\nJon\\'s anger flared. \"He said my mother was-\" \\n11 \\n-a whore. I heard him. What of it?\" \\n\"Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,\" Jon said icily. \"His honor-\" \\nPage 120\\n\\n\"-did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?\" \\nJon was cold with rage. \"Can I go?\" \\n\"You go when I tell you to go.\" \\nJon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers \\ntwisting his head around. \"Look at me when I\\'m talking to you, boy.\" \\nJon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad, \\nand he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the \\nshoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword. \"Words won\\'t make your mother a whore. She \\nwas what she was, and nothing Toad \\nsays can change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores.\" \\nNot my mother, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of \\nher. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was \\nbeautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind. \\n\"You think you had it hard, being a high lord\\'s bastard?\" the armorer went on. \"That boy Jeren is a \\nsepton\\'s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. Now he commands Eastwatch by \\nthe Sea.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care,\" Jon said. \"I don\\'t care about them and I don\\'t care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark \\nor any of it. I hate it here. It\\'s too . . . it\\'s cold.\" \\n\"Yes. Cold and hard and mean, that\\'s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet \\nnurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. This is the way it is, and you\\'re here \\nfor life, same as the rest of us.\" \\n\"Life,\" Jon repeated bitterly. The armorer could talk about life. He\\'d had one. He\\'d only taken the black \\nafter he\\'d lost an arm at the siege of Storm\\'s End. Before that he\\'d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the \\nking\\'s brother. He\\'d seen the Seven Kingdoms from one end to the other; he\\'d feasted and wenched and \\nfought in a hundred battles. They said it was Donal Noye who\\'d forged King Robert\\'s warhammer, the \\none that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. He\\'d done all the things that Jon would \\nnever do, and then when he was old, well past thirty, he\\'d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the \\nwound had festered until the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to \\nthe Wall, when his life was all but over. \\n\"Yes, life,\" Noye said. \"A long life or a short one, it\\'s up to you, Snow. The road you\\'re walking, one of \\nyour brothers will slit your throat for you one night.\" \\n\"They\\'re not my brothers,\" Jon snapped. \"They hate me because I\\'m better than they are.\" \\n\"No. They hate you because you act like you\\'re better than they are. They look at you and see a \\ncastle-bred bastard who thinks he\\'s a lordling.\" The armorer leaned close. \"You\\'re no lordling. \\nRemember that. You\\'re a Snow, not a Stark. You\\'re a bastard and a bully.\" \\nPage 121\\n\\n\"A bully?\" Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it took his breath away. \"They \\nwere the ones who came after me. Four of them.\" \\n\"Four that you\\'ve humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. I\\'ve watched you fight. \\nIt\\'s not training with you. Put a \\ngood edge on your sword, and they\\'d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave \\nthem nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?\" \\nJon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn\\'t he? But the armorer was taking that away \\ntoo, making it sound as if he were doing something wrong. \"They\\'re all older than me,\" he said \\ndefensively. \\n\"Older and bigger and stronger, that\\'s the truth. I\\'ll wager your master-at-arms taught you how to fight \\nbigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some old knight?\" \\n\"Ser Rodrik Cassel,\" Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing around him. \\nDonal Noye leaned forward, into Jon\\'s face. \"Now think on this, boy. None of these others have ever \\nhad a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths \\nand miners and oars on a trading galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the \\nalleys of Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They may have \\nclacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, not one in twenty was ever rich \\nenough to own a real sword.\" His look was grim. \"So how do you like the taste of your victories now, \\nLord Snow?\" \\n\"Don\\'t call me that!\" Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. Suddenly he felt ashamed \\nand guilty. \"I never . . . I didn\\'t think . . .\" \\n\"Best you start thinking,\" Noye warned him. \"That, or sleep with a dagger by your bed. Now go.\" \\nBy the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday. The sun had broken through the clouds. He \\nturned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing blue and crystalline in the sunlight. Even after \\nall these weeks, the sight of it still gave him the shivers. Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and \\nscoured it, covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast sky . . . but \\nwhen the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it shone, alive with light, a colossal blue-white cliff that filled up \\nhalf the sky. \\nThe largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when \\nthey had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. \"And beyond a doubt the most useless,\" Tyrion \\nLannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from \\nmiles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing \\nin \\nthe far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say. \\nWhen they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers looked like nothing more than \\nPage 122\\n\\na handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, beneath the vast wall of ice. The ancient stronghold of the \\nblack brothers was no Winterfell, no true castle at all. Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from \\nthe south, or east, or west; but it was only the north that concerned the Night\\'s Watch, and to the north \\nloomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, three times the height of the tallest tower in the \\nstronghold it sheltered. His uncle said the top was wide enough for a dozen armored knights to ride \\nabreast. The gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up there, like \\nthe skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as small as ants. \\nAs he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as he had that day on the \\nkingsroad, when he\\'d seen it for the first time. The Wall was like that. Sometimes he could almost forget \\nthat it was there, the way you forgot about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times \\nwhen it seemed as if there was nothing else in the world. It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and \\nwhen he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy. He could feel the great weight of all that ice \\npressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell \\nwith it. \\n\"Makes you wonder what lies beyond,\" a familiar voice said. \\nJon looked around. \"Lannister. I didn\\'t see-I mean, I thought I was alone.\" \\nTyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small bear. \"There\\'s much to be \\nsaid for taking people unawares. You never know what you might learn.\" \\n\"You won\\'t learn anything from me,\" Jon told him. He had seen little of the dwarf since their journey \\nended. As the queen\\'s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had been an honored guest of the Night\\'s Watch. \\nThe Lord Commander had given him rooms in the King\\'s Tower-so-called, though no king had visited it \\nfor a hundred yearsand Lannister dined at Mormont\\'s own table and spent his days riding the Wall and \\nhis nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the other high officers. \\n\"Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.\" The little man gestured up at the Wall with a gnarled black walking \\nstick. \"As I was saying . . . why is it that when one man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to \\nknow what\\'s on the other side?\" He cocked his head and looked at \\nJon with his curious mismatched eyes. \"You do want to know what\\'s on the other side, don\\'t you?\" \\n\"It\\'s nothing special,\" Jon said. He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his rangings, deep into the \\nmysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance Rayder\\'s wildlings and ward the realm against the \\nOthers, but it was better not to speak of the things you wanted. \"The rangers say it\\'s just woods and \\nmountains and frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.\" \\n\"And the grumkins and the snarks,\" Tyrion said. \"Let us not forget them, Lord Snow, or else what\\'s that \\nbig thing for?\" \\n\"Don\\'t call me Lord Snow.\" \\nThe dwarf lifted an eyebrow. \"Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can \\ncut you, and you\\'ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your \\nown. Then they can\\'t hurt you with it anymore.\" He gestured with his stick. \"Come, walk with me. They\\'ll \\nbe serving some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of something hot.\" \\nPage 123\\n\\nJon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to match the dwarf\\'s awkward, \\nwaddling steps. The wind was rising, and they could hear the old wooden buildings creaking around \\nthem, and in the distance a heavy shutter banging, over and over, forgotten. Once there was a muffled \\nthump as a blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them. \\n\"I don\\'t see your wolf,\" Lannister said as they walked. \\n\"I chain him up in the old stables when we\\'re training. They board all the horses in the east stables now, \\nso no one bothers him. The rest of the time he stays with me. My sleeping cell is in Hardin\\'s Tower.\" \\n\"That\\'s the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard below, and a lean to it like \\nour noble king Robert after a long night\\'s drinking? I thought all those buildings had been abandoned.\" \\nJon shrugged. \"No one cares where you sleep. Most of the old keeps are empty, you can pick any cell \\nyou want.\" Once Castle Black had housed five thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants \\nand weapons. Now it was home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin. \\nTyrion Lannister\\'s laughter steamed in the cold air. \"I\\'ll be sure to tell your father to arrest more \\nstonemasons, before your tower collapses.\" \\nJon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. The Watch had built nineteen \\ngreat strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept \\nshore, the Shadow Tower hard by the mountains where the Wall \\nended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the kingsroad. The other keeps, long deserted, \\nwere lonely, haunted places, where cold winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the \\ndead manned the parapets. \\n\"It\\'s better that I\\'m by myself,\" Jon said stubbornly. \"The rest of them are scared of Ghost.\" \\n\"Wise boys,\" Lannister said. Then he changed the subject. \"The talk is, your uncle is too long away.\" \\nJon remembered the wish he\\'d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark dead in the snow, and he \\nlooked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in \\nhis eyes. \"He said he\\'d be back by my name day,\" he admitted. His name day had come and gone, \\nunremarked, a fortnight past. \"They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman to \\nLord Arryn. Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower. That\\'s all the way up in \\nthe mountains.\" \\n\"I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,\" Lannister said as they mounted the steps to the \\ncommon hall. He grinned and pulled open the door. \"Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.\" \\nInside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great hearth. Crows nested in the \\ntimbers of its lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of \\nblack bread from the day\\'s cooks. Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench \\nnearest the warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices. Jon eyed them thoughtfully for a \\nmoment. Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well away from the other diners. \\nPage 124\\n\\nTyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. \"Barley, onion, carrot,\" he \\nmuttered. \"Someone should tell the cooks that turnip isn\\'t a meat.\" \\n\"It\\'s mutton stew.\" Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the steam rising from the bowl. The \\nsmell made his mouth water. \\n\"Snow.\" \\nJon knew Alliser Thorne\\'s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had not heard before. He \\nturned. \\n\"The Lord Commander wants to see you. Now.\" \\nFor a moment Jon was too frightened to move. Why would the Lord Commander want to see him? \\nThey had heard something about Benjen, he thought wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. \"Is it \\nmy uncle?\" he blurted. \"Is he returned safe?\" \\n\"The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,\" was Ser \\nAlliser\\'s reply. \"And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.\" \\nTyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose. \"Stop it, Thorne. You\\'re frightening the boy.\" \\n\"Keep out of matters that don\\'t concern you, Lannister. You have no place here.\" \\n\"I have a place at court, though,\" the dwarf said, smiling. \"A word in the right ear, and you\\'ll die a sour \\nold man before you get another boy to train. Now tell Snow why the Old Bear needs to see him. Is there \\nnews of his uncle?\" \\n\"No,\" Ser Alliser said. \"This is another matter entirely. A bird arrived this morning from Winterfell, with a \\nmessage that concerns his brother.\" He corrected himself. \"His half brother.\" \\n\"Bran,\" Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. \"Something\\'s happened to Bran.\" \\nTyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm. \"Jon,\" he said. \"I am truly sorry.\" \\nJon scarcely heard him. He brushed off Tyrion\\'s hand and strode across the hall. He was running by the \\ntime he hit the doors. He raced to the Commander\\'s Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. When the \\nguards passed him, he took the tower steps two at a time. By the time he burst into the presence of the \\nLord Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting. \"Bran,\" he said. \"What \\ndoes it say about Bran?\" \\nJeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch, was a gruff old man with an immense bald head \\nand a shaggy grey beard. He had a raven on his arm, and he was feeding it kernels of corn. \"I am told \\nyou can read.\" He shook the raven off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat \\nwatching as Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon. \"Com, \" it muttered in a \\nraucous voice. \"Com, com. \" \\nJon\\'s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken seat. He recognized Robb\\'s \\nPage 125\\n\\nhand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried to read them. He realized he was crying. And \\nthen, through the tears, he found the sense in the words, and raised his head. \"He woke up,\" he said. \\n\"The gods gave him back.\" \\n\"Crippled,\" Mormont said. \"I\\'m sorry, boy. Read the rest of the letter.\" \\nHe looked at the words, but they didn\\'t matter. Nothing mattered. Bran was going to live. \"My brother is \\ngoing to live,\" he told Mormont. The Lord Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and \\nwhistled. The raven flew to his shoulder, crying, \"Live! Live!\" \\nJon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb\\'s letter in his hand. \"My brother is going to live,\" \\nhe told the guards. They exchanged a look. He ran back to the common hall, where he found Tyrion \\nLannister just finishing his meal. He grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and \\nspun him around in a circle. \"Bran is going to live!\" he whooped. Lannister looked startled. Jon put him \\ndown and thrust the paper into his hands. \"Here, read it,\" he said. \\nOthers were gathering around and looking at him curiously. Jon noticed Grenn a few feet away. A thick \\nwoolen bandage was wrapped around one hand. He looked anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at \\nall. Jon went to him. Grenn edged backward and put up his hands. \"Stay away from me now, you \\nbastard.\" \\nJon smiled at him. \"I\\'m sorry about your wrist. Robb used the same move on me once, only with a \\nwooden blade. It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be worse. Look, if you want, I can show you how \\nto defend that.\" \\nAlliser Thorne overheard him. \"Lord Snow wants to take my place now.\" He sneered. \"I\\'d have an \\neasier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training this aurochs.\" \\n\"I\\'ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,\" Jon said. \"I\\'d love to see Ghost juggle.\" \\nJon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked. Silence fell. \\nThen Tyrion Lannister guffawed. Three of the black brothers joined in from a nearby table. The laughter \\nspread up and down the benches, until even the cooks joined in. The birds stirred in the rafters, and \\nfinally even Grenn began to chuckle. \\nSer Alliser never took his eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, his face darkened, and his \\nsword hand curled into a fist. \"That was a grievous error, Lord Snow,\" he said at last in the acid tones of \\nan enemy. \\nEDDARD \\nEddard Stark rode through the towering bronze doors of the Red Keep sore, tired, hungry, and irritable. \\nHe was still a horse, dreaming of a long hot soak, a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king\\'s \\nsteward told him that Grand Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The \\nhonor of the Hand\\'s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. \"It will be convenient on the \\nmorrow,\" Ned snapped as he dismounted. \\nPage 126\\n\\nThe steward bowed very low. \"I shall give the councillors your regrets, my lord.\" \\n\"No, damn it,\" Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had even begun. \"I will see \\nthem. Pray give me a few moments to change into something more presentable.\" \\n\"Yes, my lord,\" the steward said. \"We have given you Lord Arryn\\'s former chambers in the Tower of \\nthe Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken there.\" \\n\"My thanks,\" Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into his belt. The rest of his \\nhousehold was coming through the gate behind him. Ned saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called \\nout. \"It seems the council has urgent need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell \\nJory to keep them there. Arya is not to go exploring.\" Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal \\nsteward. \"My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate garments.\" \\n\"It will be my great pleasure,\" the steward said. \\nAnd so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bonetired and dressed in borrowed clothing, \\nto find four members of the small council waiting for him. \\nThe chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of rushes, and in one corner \\na hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls \\nwere hung with tapestries from Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the \\ndoor, eyes of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces. \\nThe councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment he entered. \"Lord Stark, I \\nwas grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light \\ncandles for Prince Joffrey. I pray for his recovery.\" His hand left powder stains on Ned\\'s sleeve, and he \\nsmelled as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave. \\n\"Your gods have heard you,\" Ned replied, cool yet polite. \"The prince grows stronger every day.\" He \\ndisentangled himself from the eunuch\\'s grip and crossed the room to where Lord Renly stood by the \\nscreen, talking quietly with a short man who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight \\nwhen Robert won the throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it \\ndisconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and Robert stood before \\nhim, fresh from his victory on the Trident. \\n\"I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,\" Renly said. \\n\"And you as well,\" Ned replied. \"You must forgive me, but sometimes you look the very image of your \\nbrother Robert.\" \\n\"A poor copy,\" Renly said with a shrug. \\n\"Though much better dressed,\" Littlefinger quipped. \"Lord Renly spends more on clothing than half the \\nladies of the court.\" \\nIt was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden stags embroidered on his \\nPage 127\\n\\ndoublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald \\nbrooch. \"There are worse crimes,\" Renly said with a laugh. \"The wayyou dress, for one.\" \\nLittlefinger ignored the jibe. He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that bordered on insolence. \"I have \\nhoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.\" \\n\"She has,\" Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of \\nthe comment rankled him. \"I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.\" \\nRenly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen. \\n\"Rather too well,\" Littlefinger said. \"I still carry a token of his esteem. Did Brandon speak of me too?\" \\n\"Often, and with some heat,\" Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no patience with this game they \\nplayed, this dueling with words. \\n\"I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,\" Littlefinger said. \"Here in the south, they say you are \\nall made of ice, and melt when you ride below the Neck.\" \\n\"I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.\" Ned moved to the council table and \\nsaid, \"Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.\" \\nThe Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. \"Well enough for a man of \\nmy years, my lord,\" he replied, \"yet I do tire easily, I fear.\" Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad \\nbald dome of his forehead above a kindly face. His maester\\'s collar was no simple metal choker such as \\nLuwin wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace that covered \\nhim from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known to man: black iron and red gold, \\nbright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and \\namethysts and black pearls adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. \"Perhaps we \\nmight begin soon,\" the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad stomach. \"I fear I shall \\nfall asleep if we wait much longer.\" \\n\"As you will.\" The king\\'s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned stag of Baratheon \\nembroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair beside it, as the right hand of his king. \"My \\nlords,\" he said formally, \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting.\" \\n\"You are the King\\'s Hand,\" Varys said. \"We serve at your pleasure, Lord Stark.\" \\nAs the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully that he did not belong here, \\nin this room, with these men. He remembered what Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell. I \\nam surrounded by flatterers andfools, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and \\nwondered which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. \"We are but five,\" \\nhe pointed out. \\n\"Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went north,\" Varys said, \"and our \\ngallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides \\nPage 128\\n\\nbeside the king as he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\" \\n\"Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,\" Ned suggested. \\nRenly Baratheon laughed aloud. \"If we wait for my brother to grace us with his royal presence, it could \\nbe a long sit.\" \\n\"Our good King Robert has many cares,\" Varys said. \"He entrusts some small matters to us, to lighten \\nhis load.\" \\n\"What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice bores my royal brother to \\ntears,\" Lord Renly said, \"so it falls to us to govern the realm. He does send us a command from time to \\ntime.\" He drew a tightly rolled paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. \"This morning he \\ncommanded me to ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at \\nonce. He has an urgent task for us.\" \\nLittlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned broke the wax with his \\nthumb and flattened the letter to consider the king\\'s urgent command, reading the words with mounting \\ndisbelief. Was there no end to Robert\\'s folly? And to do this in his name, that was salt in the wound. \\n\"Gods be good,\" he swore. \\n\"What Lord Eddard means to say,\" Lord Renly announced, \"is that His Grace instructs us to stage a \\ngreat tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of the King.\" \\n\"How much?\" asked Littlefinger, mildly. \\nNed read the answer off the letter. \"Forty thousand golden dragons to the champion. Twenty thousand \\nto the man who comes second, another twenty to the winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor \\nof the archery competition.\" \\n\"Ninety thousand gold pieces,\" Littlefinger sighed. \"And we must not neglect the other costs. Robert will \\nwant a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools \\n\"Fools we have in plenty,\" Lord Renly said. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, \"Will the treasury bear the expense?\" \\n\"What treasury is that?\" Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. \"Spare me the foolishness, Maester. \\nYou know as well as I that the treasury has been empty for years. I shall have to borrow the money. No \\ndoubt the Lannisters will be accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, \\nwhat matter another hundred thousand?\" \\nNed was stunned. \"Are you claiming that the Crown is three million gold pieces in debt?\" \\n\"The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part \\nof it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading \\ncartels. Of late I\\'ve had to turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.\" \\nPage 129\\n\\nNed was aghast. \"Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How could you let this happen?\" \\nLittlefinger gave a shrug. \"The master of coin finds the money. The king and the Hand spend it.\" \\n\"I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,\" Ned said hotly. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. \"Lord Arryn was a prudent \\nman, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to wise counsel.\" \\n\"My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,\" Renly Baratheon said, \"and he loathes what he calls \\n\\'counting coppers.\\' \" \\n\"I will speak with His Grace,\" Ned said. \"This tourney is an extravagance the realm cannot afford.\" \\n\"Speak to him as you will,\" Lord Renly said, \"we had still best make our plans.\" \\n\"Another day,\" Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. He would have to \\nremember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the king stood higher; here, he was but first \\namong equals. \"Forgive me, my lords,\" he said in a softer tone. \"I am tired. Let us call a halt for today \\nand resume when we are fresher.\" He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them \\nall, and made for the door. \\nOutside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the yard was a chaos of mud \\nand horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the \\nTrident, the Starks and their household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate \\nthemselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been seen; the talk was he \\nwas traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If so, he might be hours behind, but he \\nwould still be here too soon for Ned\\'s liking. He had only to look at Sansa\\'s face to feel the rage twisting \\ninside him once again. The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told \\nher that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard what had happened \\nto her butcher\\'s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded silently all day long, and Eddard Stark \\ndreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the Starks of Winterfell. \\nHe crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and was walking toward what \\nhe thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger appeared in front of him. \"You\\'re going the \\nwrong way, Stark. Come with me.\" \\nHesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, across a small sunken \\ncourtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of armor stood sentinel along the walls. They \\nwere relics of the Targaryens, black steel with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and \\nforgotten. \"This is not the way to my chambers,\" Ned said. \\n\"Did I say it was? I\\'m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal your corpse up behind a \\nwall,\" Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. \"We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife \\nawaits.\" \\n\"What game are you playing, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds of leagues from here.\" \\n\"Oh?\" Littlefinger\\'s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. \"Then it appears someone has managed \\nPage 130\\n\\nan astonishing impersonation. For the last time, come. Or don\\'t come, and I\\'ll keep her for myself.\" He \\nhurried down the steps. \\nNed followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no taste for these intrigues, but \\nhe was beginning to realize that they were meat and mead to a man like Littlefinger. \\nAt the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted the crossbar and gestured \\nNed through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. \\n\"We\\'re outside the castle,\" Ned said. \\n\"You are a hard man to fool, Stark,\" Littlefinger said with a smirk. \"Was it the sun that gave it away, or \\nthe sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never \\nunderstand.\" With that, he was over the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey. \\nNed studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more slowly. The niches were there, \\nas Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would be invisible from below, unless you knew just where \\nto look for them. The river was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock \\nand tried not to look down any more often than he had to. \\nWhen at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water\\'s edge, Littlefinger was lazing \\nagainst a rock and eating an apple. He was almost down to the core. \"You are growing old and slow, \\nStark,\" he said, flipping the apple casually into the rushing water. \\nA GAME, OF THRONLS 175 \\n\"No matter, we ride the rest of the way.\" He had two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted \\nbehind him, down the trail and into the city. \\nFinally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, timbered, its windows bright \\nwith lamplight in the gathering dusk. The sounds of music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated \\nover the water. Beside the door swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red \\nglass. \\nNed Stark dismounted in a fury. \"A brothel,\" he said as he seized Littlefinger by the shoulder and spun \\nhim around. \"You\\'ve brought me all this way to take me to a brothel.\" \\n\"Your wife is inside,\" Littlefinger said. \\nIt was the final insult. \"Brandon was too kind to you,\" Ned said as he slammed the small man back \\nagainst a wall and shoved his dagger up under the little pointed chin beard. \\n\"My lord, no,\" an urgent voice called out. \"He speaks the truth.\" There were footsteps behind him. \\nNed spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He was dressed in brown \\nroughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he ran. \"This is no business of yours,\" Ned \\nbegan; then, suddenly, the recognition came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. \"Ser Rodfik?\" \\nRodrik Cassel nodded. \"Your lady awaits you upstairs.\" \\nNed was lost. \"Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of Littlefinger\\'s?\" He sheathed his \\nblade. \\nPage 131\\n\\n\"Would that it were, Stark,\" Littlefinger said. \"Follow me, and try to look a shade more lecherous and a \\nshade less like the King\\'s Hand. It would not do to have you recognized. Perhaps you could fondle a \\nbreast or two, just in passing.\" \\nThey went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was singing bawdy songs while \\npretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored silk pressed themselves against their lovers and \\ndandled on their laps. No one paid Ned the least bit of attention. Ser Rodrik waited below while \\nLittlefinger led him up to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door. \\nInside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and embraced him fiercely. \\n\"My lady,\" Ned whispered in wonderment. \\n\"Oh, very good,\" said Littlefinger, closing the door. \"You recognized her.\" \\n\"I feared you\\'d never come, my lord,\" she whispered against his \\nchest. \"Petyr has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young prince. \\nHow are my girls?\" \\n\"Both in mourning, and full of anger,\" he told her. \"Cat, I do not understand. What are you doing in \\nKing\\'s Landing? What\\'s happened?\" Ned asked his wife. \"Is it Bran? Is he . . .\" Dead was the word that \\ncame to his lips, but he could not say it. \\n\"It is Bran, but not as you think,\" Catelyn said. \\nNed was lost. \"Then how? Why are you here, my love? What is this place?\" \\n\"Just what it appears,\" Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. \"A brothel. Can you think of \\na less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?\" He smiled. \"As it chances, I own this particular establishment, \\nso arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is \\nhere in King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"Why?\" Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, the raw red scars, the \\nstiffness of the last two fingers on her left. \"You\\'ve been hurt.\" He took her hands in his own, turned them \\nover. \"Gods. Those are deep cuts . . . a gash from a sword or . . . how did this happen, my lady?\" \\nCatelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. \"This blade was sent to open \\nBran\\'s throat and spill his life\\'s blood.\" \\nNed\\'s head jerked up. \"But . . . who . . . why would \\nShe put a finger to his lips. \"Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that way. Listen.\" \\nSo he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys and the guardsmen and \\nLittlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. \\nBran\\'s wolf had saved the boy\\'s life, he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the \\npups in the snow? Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord. And he had killed Sansa\\'s, and \\nPage 132\\n\\nfor what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent these wolves, what folly had he \\ndone? \\nPainfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. \"The Imp\\'s dagger,\" he \\nrepeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the \\nblade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. It stood mocking him. \"Why should Tyrion Lannister want \\nBran dead? The boy has never done him harm.\" \\n\"Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?\" Littlefinger asked. \"The Imp would never \\nhave acted alone.\" \\nNed rose and paced the length of the room. \"If the queen had a role \\nin this or, gods forbid, the king himself ... no, I will not believe that.\" Yet even as he said the words, he \\nremembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert\\'s talk of sending hired knives after the \\nTargaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar\\'s infant son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king \\nhad turned away, as he had turned away in Darry\\'s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear \\nSansa pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once. \\n\"Most likely the king did not know,\" Littlefinger said. \"It would not be the first time. Our good Robert is \\npracticed at closing his eyes to things he would rather not see.\" \\nNed had no reply for that. The face of the butcher\\'s boy swam up before his eyes, cloven almost in two, \\nand afterward the king had said not a word. His head was pounding. \\nLittlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. \"The accusation is treason \\neither way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn Payne before the words are out of your mouth. \\nThe queen . . . if you can find proof, and if you can make Robert listen, then perhaps . . . \\n\"We have proof,\" Ned said. \"We have the dagger.\" \\n\"This?\" Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. \"A sweet piece of steel, but it cuts two ways, \\nmy lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with \\nhis hireling dead, who is there to give him the lie?\" He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. \"My counsel is to \\ndrop that in the river and forget that it was ever forged.\" \\nNed regarded him coldly. \"Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son lies crippled, perhaps dying. \\nHe would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a wolf pup we found in the snow. If you truly believe I \\ncould forget that, you are as big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.\" \\n\"A fool I may be, Stark . . . yet I\\'m still here, while your brother has been moldering in his frozen grave \\nfor some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade \\nyou, but I would rather not be included in the party, thank you very much.\" \\n\"You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord Baelish.\" \\n\"You wound me deeply.\" Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. \"For my part, I always found you \\nStarks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend. \\nI shall try to keep you alive for her sake. A fool\\'s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife \\nPage 133\\n\\nanything.\" \\nLittlefinger. \"I should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.\" \\n\"A moment alone, that\\'s all I ask,\" Catelyn said. \\n\"Very well.\" Littlefinger strolled to the door. \"Don\\'t be too long. It is past time the Hand and I returned \\nto the castle, before our absence is noted.\" \\nCatelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. \"I will not forget the help you gave me, Petyr. When \\nyour men came for me, I did not know whether they were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have \\nfound you more than a friend. I have found a brother I\\'d thought lost.\" \\nPetyr Baelish smiled. \"I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell anyone. I have spent years \\nconvincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I should hate to see all that hard work go for \\nnaught.\" \\nNed believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, \"You have my thanks as well, \\nLord Baelish.\" \\n\"Oh, now there\\'s a treasure,\" Littlefinger said, exiting. \\nWhen the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. \"Once you are home, send word to \\nHelman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify \\nMoat Cailin. Two hundred determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord \\nManderly that he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are well \\nmanned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall \\nhave sore need of his father\\'s fleet.\" \\n\"War?\" The fear was plain on Catelyn\\'s face. \\n\"It will not come to that,\" Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her in his arms again. \"The \\nLannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they \\nwould not dare attack the north without all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not \\nhave. I must play out this fool\\'s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my love. \\nIf I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn . . . \\nHe felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. \"If,\" she said, \"what then, my love?\" \\nThat was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. \"All justice flows from the king,\" he told her. \"When I \\nknow the truth, I must go to Robert.\" And pray that he is the man I think he is, he finished silently, and \\nnot the man I fear he has become. \\nTYRION \\nAre you certain that you must leave us so soon?\" the Lord Commander asked him. \\nPage 134\\n\\n\"Past certain, Lord Mormont,\" Tyrion replied. \"My brother Jaime will be wondering what has become \\nof me. He may decide that you have convinced me to take the black.\" \\n\"Would that I could.\" Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his fist. Old as he was, the Lord \\nCommander still had the strength of a bear. \"You\\'re a cunning man, Tyrion. We have need of men of \\nyour sort on the Wall.\" \\nTyrion grinned. \"Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship them all to you, Lord \\nMormont.\" As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab leg and reached for another. The crabs had \\narrived from Eastwatch only this morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent. \\nSer Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a smile. \"Lannister mocks \\nus.\" \\n\"Only you, Ser Alliser,\" Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table had a nervous, uncertain \\nquality to it. \\nThorne\\'s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. \"You have a bold tongue for someone who is less \\nthan half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard together.\" \\n\"Why?\" asked Tyrion. \"The crabs are here.\" \\nThe remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his mouth a tight line. \"Come \\nand make your j apes with steel in your hand.\" \\nTyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. \"Why, I have steel in my hand, Ser Alliser, although it appears \\nto be a crab fork. Shall we duel?\" He hopped up on his chair and began poking at Thorne\\'s chest with \\nthe tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander\\'s \\nmouth as he began to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. \\n\"Duel! Duel! Duel!\" \\nSer Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had a dagger up his butt. \\nMormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. \"To the victor goes the spoils,\" \\nhe called out. \"I claim Thorne\\'s share of the crabs.\" \\nFinally the Lord Commander recovered himself. \"You are a wicked man, to provoke our Ser Alliser so,\" \\nhe scolded. \\nTyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. \"If a man paints a target on his chest, he should expect that \\nsooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I have seen dead men with more humor than your \\nSer Alliser.\" \\n\"Not so,\" objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and red as a pomegranate. \"You \\nought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains.\" \\nTyrion had heard a few of those droll names. \"I\\'ll wager the lads have a few names for him as well,\" he \\nsaid. \"Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, \\nnot drilling your young warriors.\" \\nPage 135\\n\\n\"The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,\" Lord Mormont grumbled. \"That seems to be all they send \\nus these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few \\nto take the black since I have been Lord Commander. He fought bravely at King\\'s Landing.\" \\n\"On the wrong side,\" Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. \"I ought to know, I was there on the \\nbattlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on \\nspikes before evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.\" \\n\"None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially those of people who have \\nannoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the \\ncity wall above the King\\'s Gate. I think you would have looked very striking up there.\" \\n\"Thank you,\" Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile. \\nLord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. \"Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser saw you true, Tyrion. You \\ndo mock us and our noble purpose here.\" \\nTyrion shrugged. \"We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord Mormont, lest we start to take \\nourselves too seriously. More wine, please.\" He held out his cup. \\nAs Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, \"You have a great thirst for a small man.\" \\n\"Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,\" Maester Aemon said from the far end of the table. \\nHe spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night\\'s Watch all fell quiet, the better to hear what the ancient \\nhad to say. \"I think he is a giant come among us, here at the end of the world.\" \\nTyrion answered gently, \"I\\'ve been called many things, my lord, but giant is seldom one of them.\" \\n\"Nonetheless,\" Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to Tyrion\\'s face, \"I think it is \\ntrue.\" \\nFor once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only bow his head politely and \\nsay, \"You are too kind, Maester Aemon.\" \\nThe blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken beneath the weight of a \\nhundred years so his maester\\'s collar with its links of many metals hung loose about his throat. \"I have \\nbeen called many things, my lord,\" he said, \"but kind is seldom one of them.\" This time Tyrion himself led \\nthe laughter. \\nMuch later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had left, Mormont offered \\nTyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so strong they brought tears to his eyes. \"The \\nkingsroad can be perilous this far north,\" the Lord Commander told him as they drank. \\n\"I have Jyck and Morrec,\" Tyrion said, \"and Yoren is riding south again.\" \\n\"Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,\" Mormont announced in a tone \\nthat brooked no argument. \"Three men should be sufficient.\" \\nPage 136\\n\\n\"If you insist, my lord,\" Tyrion said. \"You might send young Snow. He would be glad for a chance to see \\nhis brothers.\" \\nMormont frowned through his thick grey beard. \"Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. I think not. The young \\nones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home \\nwould only stir up feelings best left alone. I know these things. My own \\nblood kin ... my sister Maege rules Bear Island now, since my son\\'s dishonor. I have nieces I have never \\nseen.\" He took a swallow. \"Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have three strong swords, to \\nkeep you safe.\" \\n\"I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.\" The strong drink was making Tyrion light-headed, but \\nnot so drunk that he did not realize that the Old Bear wanted something from him. \"I hope I can repay \\nyour kindness.\" \\n\"You can,\" Mormont said bluntly. \"Your sister sits beside the king. Your brother is a great knight, and \\nyour father the most powerful lord in the Seven Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need \\nhere. You have seen for yourself, my lord. The Night\\'s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a \\nthousand now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower, even fewer at Eastwatch, and a \\nscant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. Think on that. Should an attack \\ncome, I have three men to defend each mile of wall.\" \\n\"Three and a third,\" Tyrion said with a yawn. \\nMormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before the fire. \"I sent Benjen \\nStark to search after Yohn Royce\\'s son, lost on his first ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer \\ngrass, yet he insisted on the honor of his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish \\nto offend his lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the Watch. \\nMore fool U\\' \\n\"Fool, \" the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him with those beady black eyes, \\nruffling its wings. \"Fool, \" it called again. Doubtless old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the \\ncreature. A pity. \\nThe Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. \"Gared was near as old as I am and longer \\non the Wall,\" he went on, \"yet it would seem he forswore himself and fled. I should never have believed \\nit, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One \\ndeserter and two men lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing.\" He sighed deeply. \"Who am I to \\nsend searching after him? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for the burden I bear, \\nyet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen Marsh? I would have to be as blind as \\nMaester Aemon not to see what they are. The Night\\'s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and \\ntired old men. Apart from the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even \\nfewer who can think, or plan, or lead. Once the Watch spent its summers building, and \\neach Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can do to stay alive.\" \\nHe was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the old man. Lord Mormont \\nPage 137\\n\\nhad spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed to believe if those years were to have any \\nmeaning. \"I promise, the king will hear of your need,\" Tyrion said gravely, \"and I will speak to my father \\nand my brother Jaime as well.\" And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left the rest \\nunsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he had taken leave of his senses, \\nand Jaime would only laugh. \\n\"You are a young man, Tyrion,\" Mormont said. \"How many winters have you seen?\" \\nHe shrugged. \"Eight, nine. I misremember.\" \\n\"And all of them short.\" \\n\"As you say, my lord.\" He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel one that the maesters \\nsaid had lasted near three years, but Tyrion\\'s earliest memories were of spring. \\n\"When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long winter to come. This summer \\nhas lasted nine years, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be upon us. Think on that.\" \\n\"When I was a boy,\" Tyrion replied, \"my wet nurse told me that one day, if men were good, the gods \\nwould give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps we\\'ve been better than we thought, and the \\nGreat Summer is finally at hand.\" He grinned. \\nThe Lord Commander did not seem amused. \"You are not fool enough to believe that, my lord. Already \\nthe days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in \\naccord with his own. The end of summer stares us in the face.\" Mormont reached out and clutched \\nTyrion tightly by the hand. \"You must make them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is coming. \\nThere are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow bears the size of aurochs, and I \\nhave seen darker shapes in my dreams.\" \\n\"In your dreams,\" Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another strong drink. \\nMormont was deaf to the edge in his voice. \"The fisherfolk near Eastwatch have glimpsed white walkers \\non the shore.\" \\nThis time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. \"The fisherfolk of Lannisport often glimpse merlings.\" \\n\"Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping past the Shadow Tower in \\nnumbers greater than ever before. They are running, my lord . . . but running from what?\" Lord \\nMormont moved to the window and stared out into the night. \"These are old bones, Lannister, but they \\nhave never felt a chill like this. Tell the king what I say, I pray you. Winter is coming, and when the Long \\nNight falls, only the Night\\'s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness that sweeps from the \\nnorth. The gods help us all if we are not ready.\" \\n\"The gods help me if I do not get some sleep tonight. Yoren is determined to ride at first light.\" Tyrion \\ngot to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom. \"I thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, \\nLord Mormont.\" \\n\"Tell them, Tyrion. Tell them and make them believe. That is all the thanks I need.\" He whistled, and his \\nPage 138\\n\\nraven flew to him and perched on his shoulder. Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his \\npocket, and that was how Tyrion left him. \\nIt was bitter cold outside. Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled on his gloves and nodded \\nto the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the Commander\\'s Keep. He set off across the yard \\nfor his own chambers in the King\\'s Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow \\ncrunched beneath his feet as his boots broke the night\\'s crust, and his breath steamed before him like a \\nbanner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying that Morrec had remembered to \\nwarm his bed with hot bricks from the fire. \\nBehind the King\\'s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, immense and mysterious. Tyrion \\nstopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs ached of cold and haste. \\nSuddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more off the end of the world. It \\nwould be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he would ride south, and he could not imagine why he \\nwould ever want to return to this frozen desolation. The King\\'s Tower was before him, with its promise \\nof warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast pale palisade of the \\nWall. \\nA wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge roughhewn beams sunk deep into the ice \\nand frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. \\nThe black brothers assured him that it was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion\\'s legs were cramping \\ntoo badly for him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the well, \\nclambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls. \\nHe had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the Wall to his back. Long \\nenough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing this. He had just about decided to forget his \\nsudden whim and go to bed when the cage gave a jerk and began to ascend. \\nHe moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The ground fell away beneath \\nhim, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the \\nmetal even through his gloves. Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the \\nLord Commander\\'s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed. \\nThen he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay below him, etched in \\nmoonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, \\ncourtyards choked with broken stone. Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole\\'s Town, the little village \\nhalf a league south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on water where \\nicy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the plains. The rest of the world was a \\nbleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky fields spotted with snow. \\nFinally a thick voice behind him said, \"Seven hells, it\\'s the dwarf,\" and the cage jerked to a sudden stop \\nand hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the ropes creaking. \\n\"Bring him in, damn it.\" There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as the cage slid sideways and \\nthen the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the swinging had stopped before he pushed open the \\ncage door and hopped down onto the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a \\nsecond held the cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their eyes \\nshowed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. \"And what will you be \\nPage 139\\n\\nwanting, this time of night?\" the one by the winch asked. \\n\"A last look.\" \\nThe men exchanged sour glances. \"Look all you want,\" the other one said. \"Just have a care you don\\'t \\nfall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.\" A small wooden shack stood under the great \\ncrane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men \\nopened the door and went back inside. And then he was alone. \\nIt was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent lover. The top of the Wall \\nwas wider than the kingsroad \\noften was, so Tyrion had no fear of falling, although the footing was slicker than he would have liked. \\nThe brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless footsteps would \\nmelt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the gravel, swallowing it, until the path was \\nbare again and it was time to crush more stone. \\nStill, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east and west, at the Wall \\nstretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and no end and a dark abyss on either side. \\nWest, he decided, for no special reason, and he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest \\nthe north edge, where the gravel looked freshest. \\nHis bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more loudly with every step, but \\nTyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the \\nwhite ribbon followed the lines of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western \\nhorizon. He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. The \\nthrowing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like a broken toy, \\nhalf-embedded in the ice. \\nOn the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. \"Who goes there? Halt!\" \\nTyrion stopped. \"If I halt too long I\\'ll freeze in place, Jon,\" he said as a shaggy pale shape slid toward \\nhim silently and sniffed at his furs. \"Hello, Ghost.\" \\nJon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and leather, the hood of his \\ncloak pulled down over his face. \"Lannister,\" he said, yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. \"This \\nis the last place I would have expected to see you.\" He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he \\nwas, and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his chest was a gleaming black warhorn, \\nbanded with silver. \\n\"This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,\" Tyrion admitted. \"I was captured by a whim. If \\nI touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?\" \\n\"Not with me here,\" Jon promised. \\nTyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears. The red eyes watched him impassively. The beast came \\nup as high as his chest now. Another year, and Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he\\'d be looking up at him. \\n\"What are you doing up here tonight?\" he asked. \"Besides freezing your manhood off . . .\" \\nPage 140\\n\\n\"I have drawn night guard,\" Jon said. \"Again. Ser Alliser has kindly arranged for the watch commander \\nto take a special interest in me. He seems to think that if they keep me awake half the night, I\\'ll fall asleep \\nduring morning drill. So far I have disappointed him.\" \\nTyrion grinned. \"And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?\" \\n\"No,\" said Jon, smiling, \"but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, and Pyp is no longer \\ndropping his sword quite so often as he did.\" \\n\"Pyp?\" \\n\"Pypar is his real name. The small boy with the large ears. He saw me working with Grenn and asked for \\nhelp. Thorne had never even shown him the proper way to grip a sword.\" He turned to look north. \"I \\nhave a mile of Wall to guard. Will you walk with me?\" \\n\"If you walk slowly,\" Tyrion said. \\n\"The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, but he never said how \\nfast.\" \\nThey walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow. \"I leave on the morrow,\" Tyrion \\nsaid. \\n\"I know.\" Jon sounded strangely sad. \\n\"I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south. If there is any message that you would like me to deliver . \\n. .\" \\n\"Tell Robb that I\\'m going to command the Night\\'s Watch and keep him safe, so he might as well take up \\nneedlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down his sword for horseshoes.\" \\n\"Your brother is bigger than me,\" Tyrion said with a laugh. \"I decline to deliver any message that might \\nget me killed.\" \\n\"Rickon will ask when I\\'m coming home. Try to explain where I\\'ve gone, if you can. Tell him he can have \\nall my things while I\\'m away, he\\'ll like that.\" \\nPeople seemed to be asking a great deal of him today, Tyrion Lannister thought. \"You could put all this \\nin a letter, you know.\" \\n\"Rickon can\\'t read yet. Bran . . .\" He stopped suddenly. \"I don\\'t know what message to send to Bran. \\nHelp him, Tyrion.\" \\n\"What help could I give him? I am no maester, to ease his pain. I have no spells to give him back his \\nlegs.\" \\n\"You gave me help when I needed it,\" Jon Snow said. \\n\"I gave you nothing,\" Tyrion said. \"Words.\" \\nPage 141\\n\\n\"Then give your words to Bran too.\" \\n\"You\\'re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,\" Tyrion said. \"However sincere the lesson, \\nthe result is likely to be grotesque. Still, I know what it is to love a brother, Lord Snow. I will give Bran \\nwhatever small help is in my power.\" \\n\"Thank you, my lord of Lannister.\" He pulled off his glove and offered his bare hand. \"Friend.\" \\nTyrion found himself oddly touched. \"Most of my kin are bastards,\" he said with a wry smile, \"but you\\'re \\nthe first I\\'ve had to friend.\" He pulled a glove off with his teeth and clasped Snow by the hand, flesh \\nagainst flesh. The boy\\'s grip was firm and strong. \\nWhen he had donned his glove again, Jon Snow turned abruptly and walked to the low, icy northern \\nparapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him there was only the darkness and the wild. \\nTyrion followed him, and side by side they stood upon the edge of the world. \\nThe Night\\'s Watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of the north face of the Wall. \\nThe thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had once grown there had been harvested centuries \\nago, to create a broad swath of open ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen. Tyrion \\nhad heard that elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come creeping \\nback over the decades, that there were places where greygreen sentinels and pale white weirwoods had \\ntaken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and \\nhere the forest was still kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers. \\nIt was never far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees looming beyond the stretch of \\nopen ground, like a second wall built parallel to the first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in that \\nblack wood, where even the moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and \\ngrasping limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and knew not \\nmen. It was small wonder the Night\\'s Watch named it the haunted forest. \\nAs he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning anywhere, with the wind blowing \\nand the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion Lannister felt as though he could almost believe the talk of the \\nOthers, the enemy in the night. His jokes of grumkins and snarks no longer seemed quite so droll. \\n\"My uncle is out there,\" Jon Snow said softly, leaning on his spear as he stared off into the darkness. \\n\"The first night they sent me up here, I thought, Uncle Benjen will ride back tonight, and I\\'ll see him first \\nand blow the horn. He never came, though. Not that night and not any night.\" \\n\"Give him time,\" Tyrion said. \\nFar off to the north, a wolf began to howl. Another voice picked up \\nthe call, then another. Ghost cocked his head and listened. \"If he doesn\\'t come back,\" Jon Snow \\npromised, \"Ghost and I will go find him.\" He put his hand on the direwolf\\'s head. \\n\"I believe you,\" Tyrion said, but what he thought was, And who will go find you? He shivered. \\nPage 142\\n\\nARYA \\nHer father had been fighting with the council again. Arya could see it on his face when he came to table, \\nlate again, as he had been so often. The first course, a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins, had \\nalready been taken away when Ned Stark strode into the Small Hall. They called it that to set it apart \\nfrom the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room with a high vaulted \\nceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables. \\n\"My lord,\" Jory said when Father entered. He rose to his feet, and the rest of the guard rose with him. \\nEach man wore a new cloak, heavy grey wool with a white satin border. A hand of beaten silver clutched \\nthe woolen folds of each cloak and marked their wearers as men of the Hand\\'s household guard. There \\nwere only fifty of them, so most of the benches were empty. \\n\"Be seated,\" Eddard Stark said. \"I see you have started without me. I am pleased to know there are still \\nsome men of sense in this city.\" He signaled for the meal to resume. The servants began bringing out \\nplatters of ribs, roasted in a crust of garlic and herbs. \\n\"The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,\" Jory said as he resumed his seat. \"They say \\nthat knights will come from all over the realm to joust and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of \\nthe King.\" \\nArya could see that her father was not very happy about that. \"Do they also say this is the last thing in \\nthe world I would have wished?\" \\nSansa\\'s eyes had grown wide as the plates. \"A tourney,\" she breathed. She was seated between Septa \\nMordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could get without drawing a reproach from Father. \\n\"Will we be permitted to go, Father?\" \\n\"You know my feelings, Sansa. It seems I must arrange Robert\\'s games and pretend to be honored for \\nhis sake. That does not mean I must subject my daughters to this folly.\" \\n\"Oh, please,\" Sansa said. \"I want to see.\" \\nSepta Mordane spoke up. \"Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her younger than Lady Sansa. \\nAll the ladies of the court will be expected at a grand event like this, and as the tourney is in your honor, it \\nwould look queer if your family did not attend.\" \\nFather looked pained. \"I suppose so. Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, Sansa.\" He saw Arya. \\n\"For both of you.\" \\n\"I don\\'t care about their stupid tourney,\" Arya said. She knew Prince Jofftey would be there, and she \\nhated Prince Joffrey. \\nSansa lifted her head. \"It will be a splendid event. You shan\\'t be wanted.\" \\nAnger flashed across Father\\'s face. \"Enough, Sansa. More of that and you will change my mind. I am \\nPage 143\\n\\nweary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. You are sisters. I expect you to behave like \\nsisters, is that understood?\" \\nSansa bit her lip and nodded. Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her plate. She could feel tears \\nstinging her eyes. She rubbed them away angrily, determined not to cry. \\nThe only sound was the clatter of knives and forks. \"Pray excuse me,\" her father announced to the table. \\n\"I find I have small appetite tonight.\" He walked from the hall. \\nAfter he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. Down the table Jory laughed at \\na joke, and Hullen started in about horseflesh. \"Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the \\njoust. Not the same thing, oh, no, not the same at all.\" The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, \\nand Hullen\\'s son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine. \\nNo one talked to Arya. She didn\\'t care. She liked it that way. She would have eaten her meals alone in \\nher bedchamber if they let her. Sometimes they did, when Father had to dine with the king or some lord \\nor the envoys from this place or that place. The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just him and her and \\nSansa. That was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with \\nbaby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and call her \"little sister\" \\nand finish her sentences with her. But all of them were gone. She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa \\nwouldn\\'t even talk to her unless Father made her. \\nBack at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her father used to say that a \\nlord needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep them. \"Know the men who follow you,\" she heard \\nhim tell Robb once, \"and let them know you. Don\\'t ask your men to die for a stranger.\" At Winterfell, he \\nalways had an extra seat set at his own table, and every day a different man would be asked to join him. \\nOne night it would be Vayon Poole, and the talk would be coppers and bread stores and servants. The \\nnext time it would be Mikken, and her father would listen to him go on about armor and swords and how \\nhot a forge should be and the best way to temper steel. Another day it might be Hullen with his endless \\nhorse talk, or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old Nan with her stories. \\nArya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father\\'s table and listen to them talk. She had loved \\nlistening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough as leather, courtly knights and bold young \\nsquires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the \\nkitchen. Their wives gave her scones and she invented names for their babies and played \\nmonsters-andmaidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their children. Fat Tom used \\nto call her \"Arya Underfoot,\" because he said that was where she always was. She\\'d liked that a lot \\nbetter than \"Arya Horseface.\" \\nOnly that was Winterfell, a world away, and now everything was changed. This was the first time they \\nhad supped with the men since arriving in King\\'s Landing. Arya hated it. She hated the sounds of their \\nvoices now, the way they laughed, the stories they told. They\\'d been her friends, she\\'d felt safe around \\nthem, but now she knew that was a lie. They\\'d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible enough, but then \\nthe Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he\\'d cut him up in so many pieces that they\\'d \\ngiven him back to the butcher in a bag, and at first the poor man had thought it was a pig they\\'d \\nslaughtered. And no one had raised a voice or drawn a blade or anything, not Harwin who always talked \\nso bold, or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not even her \\nfather. \\nPage 144\\n\\n\"He was my ffiend,\" Arya whispered into her plate, so low that no one could hear. Her ribs sat there \\nuntouched, grown cold now, a thin film of grease congealing beneath them on the plate. Arya looked at \\nthem and felt ill. She pushed away from the table. \\n\"Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?\" Septa Mordane asked. \\n\"I\\'m not hungry.\" Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies. \"May I be excused, please?\" she \\nrecited stiffly. \\n\"You may not,\" the septa said. \"You have scarcely touched your food. You will sit down and clean your \\nplate.\" \\n\"You clean it!\" Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted for the door as the men laughed and Septa \\nMordane called loudly after her, her voice rising higher and higher. \\nFat Tom was at his post, guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand. He blinked when he saw Arya \\nrushing toward him and heard the septa\\'s shouts. \"Here now, little one, hold on,\" he started to say, \\nreaching, but Arya slid between his legs and then she was running up the winding tower steps, her feet \\nhammering on the stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her. \\nHer bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King\\'s Landing, and the thing she liked best \\nabout it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with black iron bands. When she slammed that door \\nand dropped the heavy crossbar, nobody could get into her room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or \\nSansa or Jory or the Hound, nobody! She slammed it now. \\nWhen the bar was down, Arya finally felt safe enough to cry. \\nShe went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and herself most of all. It was all her \\nfault, everything bad that had happened. Sansa said so, and Jeyne too. \\nFat Tom was knocking on her door. \"Arya girl, what\\'s wrong?\" he called out. \"You in there?\" \\n\"No!\" she shouted. The knocking stopped. A moment later she heard him going away. Fat Tom was \\nalways easy to fool. \\nArya went to the chest at the foot of her bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and began pulling her clothes \\nout with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin and velvet and wool and tossing them on the \\nfloor. It was there at the bottom of the chest, where she\\'d hidden it. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and \\ndrew the slender blade from its sheath. \\nNeedle. \\nShe thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears. Her fault, her fault, her fault. If she had never \\nasked him to play at swords with her . . . \\nThere was a pounding at her door, louder than before. \\'Arya Stark, you open this door at once, do you \\nhear me?\" \\nPage 145\\n\\nArya spun around, with Needle in her hand. \"You better not come in here!\" she warned. She slashed at \\nthe air savagely. \\n\"The Hand will hear of this!\" Septa Mordane raged. \\n\"I don\\'t care,\" Arya screamed. \"Go away.\" \\n\"You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that. \\nArya listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septa\\'s receding footsteps. \\nShe went back to the window, Needle in hand, and looked down into the courtyard below. If only she \\ncould climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out the window and down the tower, run away from \\nthis horrible place, away from Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal \\nsome food from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could find \\nNymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they\\'d return to Winterfell, or run to Jon on \\nthe Wall. She found herself wishing that Jon was here with her now. Then maybe she wouldn\\'t feel so \\nalone. \\nA soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and her dreams of escape. \\n\"Arya,\" her father\\'s voice called out. \"Open the door. We need to talk.\" \\nArya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar. Father was alone. He seemed more sad than angry. That \\nmade Arya feel even worse. \"May I come in?\" Arya nodded, then dropped her eyes, ashamed. Father \\nclosed the door. \"Whose sword is that?\" \\n\"Mine.\" Arya had almost forgotten Needle, in her hand. \\n\"Give it to me.\" \\nReluctantly Arya surrendered her sword, wondering if she would ever hold it again. Her father turned it \\nin the light, examining both sides of the blade. He tested the point with his thumb. \"A bravo\\'s blade,\" he \\nsaid. \"Yet it seems to me that I know this maker\\'s mark. This is Mikken\\'s work.\" \\nArya could not lie to him. She lowered her eyes. \\nLord Eddard Stark sighed. \"My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from my own forge, and I know \\nnothing of it. The Hand of the King is expected to rule the Seven Kingdoms, yet it seems I cannot even \\nrule my own household. How is it that you come to own a sword, Arya? Where did you get this?\" \\nArya chewed her lip and said nothing. She would not betray Jon, not even to their father. \\nAfter a while, Father said, \"I don\\'t suppose it matters, truly.\" He looked down gravely at the sword in his \\nhands. \"This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl. What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you \\nwere playing with swords?\" \\n\"I wasn\\'t playing,\" Arya insisted. \"I hate Septa Mordane.\" \\nPage 146\\n\\n\"That\\'s enough.\" Her father\\'s voice was curt and hard. \"The septa is doing no more than is her duty, \\nthough gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor woman. Your mother and I have charged her \\nwith the impossible task of making you a lady.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want to be a lady!\" Arya flared. \\n\"I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now, and put an end to this nonsense.\" \\n\"Needle wouldn\\'t break,\" Arya said defiantly, but her voice betrayed her words. \\n\"It has a name, does it?\" Her father sighed. \"Ah, Arya. You have a wildness in you, child. \\'The wolf \\nblood,\\' my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it, and my brother Brandon more than a touch. It \\nbrought them both to an early grave.\" Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his \\nfather, or of the brother and sister who had died before she was born. \"Lyanna might have carried a \\nsword, if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even look like her.\" \\n\"Lyanna was beautiful,\" Arya said, startled. Everybody said so. It was not a thing that was ever said of \\nArya. \\n\"She was,\" Eddard Stark agreed, \"beautiful, and willful, and dead before her time.\" He lifted the sword, \\nheld it out between them. \"Arya, what did you think to do with this . . . Needle? Who did you hope to \\nskewer? Your sister? Septa Mordane? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?\" \\nAll she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her. \"Stick them with the pointy end,\" she blurted \\nout. \\nHer father snorted back laughter. \"That is the essence of it, I suppose.\" \\nArya desperately wanted to explain, to make him see. \"I was trying to learn, but . . .\" Her eyes filled with \\ntears. \"I asked Mycah to practice with me.\" The grief came on her all at once. She turned away, shaking. \\n\"I asked him,\" she cried. \"It was my fault, it was me . . .\" \\nSuddenly her father\\'s arms were around her. He held her gently as she turned to him and sobbed against \\nhis chest. \"No, sweet one,\" he murmured. \"Grieve for your friend, but never blame yourself. You did not \\nkill the butcher\\'s boy. That murder lies at the Hound\\'s door, him and the cruel woman he serves.\" \\n\"I hate them,\" Arya confided, red-faced, sniffling. \"The Hound and the queen and the king and Prince \\nJoffrey. I hate all of them. Joffrey lied, it wasn\\'t the way he said. I hate Sansa too. She did remember, she \\njust lied so Joffrey would like her.\" \\n\"We all lie,\" her father said. \"Or did you truly think I\\'d believe that Nymeria ran off?\" \\nArya blushed guiltily. \"Jory promised not to tell.\" \\n\"Jory kept his word,\" her father said with a smile. \"There are some things I do not need to be told. Even \\na blind man could see that wolf would never have left you willingly.\" \\n\"We had to throw rocks,\" she said miserably. \"I told her to run, to go be free, that I didn\\'t want her \\nPage 147\\n\\nanymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we heard them howling, and Jory said the woods \\nwere full of game, so she\\'d have deer to hunt. Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks. \\nI hit her twice. She whined and looked at me and I felt so \\'shamed, but it was right, wasn\\'t it? The queen \\nwould have killed her.\" \\n\"It was right,\" her father said. \"And even the lie was . . . not without honor.\" He\\'d put Needle aside when \\nhe went to Arya to embrace her. Now he took the blade up again and walked to the window, where he \\nstood for a moment, looking out across the courtyard. When he turned back, his eyes were thoughtful. \\nHe seated himself on the window seat, Needle across his lap. \"Arya, sit down. I need to try and explain \\nsome things to you.\" \\nShe perched anxiously on the edge of her bed. \"You are too young to be burdened with all my cares,\" \\nhe told her, \"but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.\" \\n\"Winter is coming, \" Arya whispered. \\n\"The hard cruel times,\" her father said. \"We tasted them on the Trident, child, and when Bran fell. You \\nwere born in the long summer, sweet one, you\\'ve never known anything else, but now the winter is truly \\ncoming. Remember the sigil of our House, Arya.\" \\n\"The direwolf,\" she said, thinking of Nymeria. She hugged her knees against her chest, suddenly afraid. \\n\"Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone \\nwolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one \\nanother, keep each other warm, share our strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would \\ntruly do us harm. Septa Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa . . . Sansa is your sister. You may be as \\ndifferent as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your hearts. You need her, as \\nshe needs you . . . and I need both of you, gods help me.\" \\nHe sounded so tired that it made Arya sad. \"I don\\'t hate Sansa,\" she told him. \"Not truly.\" It was only \\nhalf a lie. \\n\"I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you. We have \\ncome to a dark dangerous place, child. This is not Winterfell. We have enemies who mean us ill. We \\ncannot fight a war among ourselves. This willfulness of yours, the running off, the angry words, the \\ndisobedience . . . at home, these were only the summer games of a child. Here and now, with winter \\nsoon upon us, that is a different matter. It is time to begin growing up.\" \\n\"I will,\" Arya vowed. She had never loved him so much as she did in that instant. \"I can be strong too. I \\ncan be as strong as Robb.\" \\nHe held Needle out to her, hilt first. \"Here.,, \\nShe looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes. For a moment she was afraid to touch it, afraid that if \\nshe reached for it it would be snatched away again, but then her father said, \"Go on, it\\'s yours,\" and she \\ntook it in her hand. \\n\"I can keep it?\" she said. \"For true?\" \\nPage 148\\n\\n\"For true.\" He smiled. \"If I took it away, no doubt I\\'d find a morningstar hidden under your pillow within \\nthe fortnight. Try not to stab your sister, whatever the provocation.\" \\n\"I won\\'t. I promise.\" Arya clutched Needle tightly to her chest as her father took his leave. \\nThe next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane and asked for her pardon. \\nThe septa peered at her suspiciously, but Father nodded. \\nThree days later, at midday, her father\\'s steward Vayon Poole sent Arya to the Small Hall. The trestle \\ntables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against the walls. The hall seemed empty, until an \\nunfamiliar voice said, \"You are late, boy.\" A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose \\nstepped out of the shadows, holding a pair of slender wooden swords. \"Tomorrow you will be here at \\nmidday.\" He had an accent, the lilt of the Free Cities, Braavos perhaps, or Myr. \\n\"Who are you?\" Arya asked. \\n\"I am your dancing master.\" He tossed her one of the wooden blades. She grabbed for it, missed, and \\nheard it clatter to the floor. \"Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up.\" \\nIt was not just a stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard and pommel. Arya \\npicked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding it out in front of her. It was heavier than it \\nlooked, much heavier than Needle. \\nThe bald man clicked his teeth together. \"That is not the way, boy. This is not a greatsword that is \\nneeding two hands to swing it. You will take the blade in one hand.\" \\n\"It\\'s too heavy,\" Arya said. \\n\"It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing. A hollow inside is filled with \\nlead, just so. One hand now is all that is needing.\" \\nArya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants. She held the sword in her \\nleft hand. He seemed to approve. \"The left is good. All is reversed, it will make your enemies more \\nawkward. Now you are standing wrong. Turn your body sideface, yes, so. You are skinny as the shaft of \\na spear, do you know. That is good too, the target is smaller. Now the grip. Let me see.\" He moved \\ncloser and peered at her hand, prying her fingers apart, rearranging them. \"Just so, yes. Do not squeeze it \\nso tight, no, the grip must be deft, delicate.\" \\n\"What if I drop it?\" Arya said. \\n\"The steel must be part of your arm,\" the bald man told her. \"Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine \\nyears Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.\" \\nIt was the third time he had called her \"boy.\" \"I\\'m a girl,\" Arya objected. \\n\"Boy, girl,\" Syrio Forel said. \"You are a sword, that is all.\" He clicked his teeth together. \"Just so, that is \\nthe grip. You are not holding a battle-axe, you are holding a-\" \\nPage 149\\n\\n\\'~--needle, \" Arya finished for him, fiercely. \\n\"Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the iron dance of Westeros we are \\nlearning, the knight\\'s dance, hacking and hammering, no. This is the bravo\\'s dance, the water dance, swift \\nand sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? When you pierce them, the water leaks out \\nand they die.\" He took a step backward, raised his own wooden blade. \"Now you will try to strike me.,, \\nArya tried to strike him. She tried for four hours, until every muscle in her body was sore and aching, \\nwhile Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together and told her what to do. \\nThe next day their real work began. \\nDAENERYS \\n\"The Dothraki sea,\" Ser Jorah Mormont said as he reined to a halt beside her on the top of the ridge. \\nbeneath them, the plain stretched out immense and empty, a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant \\nhorizon and beyond. It was a sea, Dany thought. Past here, there were no hills, no mountains, no trees \\nnor cities nor roads, only the endless grasses, the tall blades rippling like waves when the winds blew. \\n\"It\\'s so green,\" she said. \\n\"Here and now,\" Ser Jorah agreed. \"You ought to see it when it blooms, all dark red flowers from \\nhorizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, and the world turns the color of old \\nbronze. And this is only hranna, child. There are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as \\nlemon and as dark as indigo, blue grasses and orange grasses and grasses like rainbows. Down in the \\nShadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are oceans of ghost grass, taller than a man on horseback \\nwith stalks as pale as milkglass. It murders all other grass and glows in the dark with the spirits of the \\ndamned. The Dothraki claim that someday ghost grass will cover the entire world, and then all life will \\nend.\" \\nThat thought gave Dany the shivers. \"I don\\'t want to talk about that now,\" she said. \"It\\'s so beautiful \\nhere, I don\\'t want to think about everything dying.\" \\n\"As you will, Khaleesi,\" Ser Jorah said respectfully. \\nShe heard the sound of voices and turned to look behind her. She and Mormont had outdistanced the \\nrest of their party, and now the others were climbing the ridge below them. Her handmaid Irri and the \\nyoung archers of her khas were fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the \\nflat saddle. Her brother was miserable out here. He ought never have come. Magister Illyrio had urged \\nhim to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his manse, but Viserys would have none of it. He \\nwould stay with Drogo until the debt had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised. \"And \\nif he tries to cheat me, he will learn to his sorrow what it means to wake the dragon,\" Viserys had vowed, \\nlaying a hand on his borrowed sword. Illyrio had blinked at that and wished him good fortune. \\nDany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother\\'s complaints right now. The day was \\ntoo perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them a hunting hawk circled. The grass sea \\nswayed and sighed with each breath of wind, the air was warm on her face, and Dany felt at peace. She \\nPage 150\\n\\nwould not let Viserys spoil it. \\n\"Wait here,\" Dany told Ser Jorah. \"Tell them all to stay. Tell them I command it.\" \\nThe knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had a neck and shoulders like a bull, and \\ncoarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly that there was none left for his head. Yet his \\nsmiles gave Dany comfort. \"You are learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.\" \\n\"Not a queen,\" said Dany. \"A khaleesi. \" She wheeled her horse about and galloped down the ridge \\nalone. \\nThe descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and the danger of it were a \\nsong in her heart. All her life Viserys had told her she was a princess, but not until she rode her silver had \\nDaenerys Targaryen ever felt like one. \\nAt first it had not come easy. The khalasar had broken camp the morning after her wedding, moving east \\ntoward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on \\nher bottom, hideous and bloody. Her thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the \\nmuscles of her legs and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her \\nhandmaids would need to help her down from her mount. \\nEven the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, even as he had ignored her \\nduring their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize \\nhorses, watching women dance and men die. Dany had no place \\nin these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to \\ncry herself to sleep. Yet every night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and \\nwake her in the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from behind, \\nDothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband could not see the tears that wet \\nher face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his \\neyes and begin to snore softly and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too \\nmuch for sleep. \\nDay followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not endure a moment longer. She \\nwould kill herself rather than go on, she decided one night . . . \\nYet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys was not in it this time. There \\nwas only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany \\nsensed. Its eyes were pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out \\nin a hot jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow \\nher whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She could feel her flesh sear and \\nblacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt \\nstrong and new and fierce. \\nAnd the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as if the gods had heard her \\nand taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. \"Khaleesi, \" Jhiqui said, \"what is wrong? Are you \\nsick?\" \\n\"I was,\" she answered, standing over the dragon\\'s eggs that Illyrio had given her when she wed. She \\nPage 151\\n\\ntouched one, the largest of the three, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and-scarlet, she \\nthought, like the dragon in my dream. The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers . . . or was she \\nstill dreaming? She pulled her hand back nervously. \\nFrom that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before it. Her legs grew stronger; her blisters \\nburst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs toughened, supple as leather. \\nThe khal had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the Dothraki fashion, but it was the \\nfilly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to know her moods, as if they shared a single mind. \\nWith every passing day, Dany felt surer in her seat. The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, \\nand it was not their custom to name \\ntheir animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She had never loved anything so much. \\nAs the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the land around her. She rode \\nat the head of the khalasar with Drogo and his bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and \\nunspoiled. Behind them the great horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of \\nchoking dust, but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant. \\nThey crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small villages where the townsfolk \\nwatched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that \\nwas swift and narrow and treacherous, camped beside a high blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of \\na vast dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They raced down \\nValyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. For half a moon, they rode \\nthrough the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of \\nthe trees were as wide as city gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and lemurs \\nwith silver fur and huge purple eyes, but all fled before the approach of the khalasar and Dany got no \\nglimpse of them. \\nBy then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day\\'s riding, yet somehow the pain \\nhad a sweetness to it now, and each morning she came willingly to her saddle, eager to know what \\nwonders waited for her in the lands ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still \\ncried out when Drogo took her, it was not always in pain. \\nAt the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany slowed to a trot and rode \\nout onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly alone. In the khalasar she was never alone. Khal \\nDrogo came to her only after the sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by \\nthe door of her tent, Drogo\\'s bloodriders and the men of her khas were never far, and her brother was an \\nunwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear him on the top of the ridge, his voice shrill with \\nanger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea. \\nThe green swallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and grass, mixed with the smell of \\nhorseflesh and Dany\\'s sweat and the oil in her hair. Dothraki smells. They seemed to belong here. Dany \\nbreathed it all in, laughing. She had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that \\nthick black soil. Swinging \\ndown from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off her high boots. \\nPage 152\\n\\nViserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing beneath him as he reined up too \\nhard. \"You dare!\" he screamed at her. \"You give commands to me? To me?\" He vaulted off the horse, \\nstumbling as he landed. His face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. \\n\"Have you forgotten who you are? Look at you. Look at you!\" \\nDany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing Dothraki riding leathers and a \\npainted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and \\nstained in city silks and ringmail. \\nHe was still screaming. \"You do not command the dragon. Do you understand? I am the Lord of the \\nSeven Kingdoms, I will not hear orders from some horselord\\'s slut, do you hear me?\" His hand went \\nunder her vest, his fingers digging painfully into her breast. \"Do you hear me?\" \\nDany shoved him away, hard. \\nViserys stared at her, his lilac eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. Never fought back. Rage \\ntwisted his features. He would hurt her now, and badly, she knew that. \\nCrack. \\nThe whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat and yanked him \\nbackward. He went sprawling in the grass, stunned and choking. The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he \\nstruggled to free himself. The one with the whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not \\nunderstand his words, but by then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her khas. \"Jhogo asks if \\nyou would have him dead, Khaleesi, \" Irri said. \\n\"No,\" Dany replied. \"No.\" \\nJhogo understood that. One of the others barked out a comment, and the Dothraki laughed. Irri told her, \\n\"Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him respect.\" \\nHer brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, crying incoherently, struggling \\nfor breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe. \\n\"Tell them I do not wish him harmed,\" Dany said. \\nIrri repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking Viserys around like a \\npuppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the leather embrace, a thin line of blood under \\nhis chin where the whip had cut deep. \\n\"I warned him what would happen, my lady,\" Ser Jorah Mormont said. \"I told him to stay on the ridge, \\nas you commanded.\" \\n\"I know you did,\" Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, sucking in air noisily, red-faced \\nand sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that \\nbefore? There was a hollow place inside her where her fear had been. \\n\"Take his horse,\" Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could not believe what he was \\nPage 153\\n\\nhearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. Yet the words came. \"Let my brother walk \\nbehind us back to the khalasar.\" Among the Dothraki, the man who does not ride was no man at all, the \\nlowest of the low, without honor or pride. \"Let everyone see him as he is.\" \\n\"No!\" Viserys screamed. He turned to Ser Jorah, pleading in the Common Tongue with words the \\nhorsemen would not understand. \"Hit her, Mormont. Hurt her. Your king commands it. Kill these \\nDothraki dogs and teach her.\" \\nThe exile knight looked from Dany to her brother; she barefoot, with dirt between her toes and oil in her \\nhair, he with his silks and steel. Dany could see the decision on his face. \"He shall walk, Khaleesi,\" he \\nsaid. He took her brother\\'s horse in hand while Dany remounted her silver. \\nViserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence, but he would not move, and his eyes \\nwere full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was lost in the tall grass. When they could not see him \\nanymore, Dany grew afraid. \"Will he find his way back?\" she asked Ser Jorah as they rode. \\n\"Even a man as blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,\" he replied. \\n\"He is proud. He may be too shamed to come back.\" \\nJorah laughed. \"Where else should he go? If he cannot find the khalasar, the khalasar will most surely \\nfind him. It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child.\" \\nDany saw the truth of that. The khalasar was like a city on the march, but it did not march blindly. \\nAlways scouts ranged far ahead of the main column, alert for any sign of game or prey or enemies, while \\noutriders guarded their flanks. They missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where they had come \\nfrom. These plains were a part of them . . . and of her, now. \\n\"I hit him,\" she said, wonder in her voice. Now that it was over, it seemed like some strange dream that \\nshe had dreamed. \"Ser Jorah, do you think . . . he\\'ll be so angry when he gets back She shivered. \"I \\nwoke the dragon, didn\\'t IT\\' \\nSer Jorah snorted. \"Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, and he \\ndied on the Trident. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.\" \\nHis blunt words startled her. It seemed as though all the things she had always believed were suddenly \\ncalled into question. \"You . . . you swore him your sword . . .\" \\n\"That I did, girl,\" Ser Jorah said. \"And if your brother is the shadow of a snake, what does that make his \\nservants?\" His voice was bitter. \\n\"He is still the true king. He is . . .\" \\nJorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. \"Truth now. Would you want to see Viserys sit a throne?\" \\nDany thought about that. \"He would not be a very good king, would he?\" \\n\"There have been worse . . . but not many.\" The knight gave his heels to his mount and started off again. \\nPage 154\\n\\nDany rode close beside him. \"Still,\" she said, \"the common people are waiting for him. Magister Illyrio \\nsays they are sewing dragon banners and praying for Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free \\nthem.\" \\n\"The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,\" Ser Jorah told her. \\n\"It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.\" He \\ngave a shrug. \"They never are.\" \\nDany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It went against everything that \\nViserys had ever told her to think that the people could care so little whether a true king or a usurper \\nreigned over them. Yet the more she thought on Jorah\\'s words, the more they rang of truth. \\n\"What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?\" she asked him. \\n\"Home,\" he said. His voice was thick with longing. \\n\"I pray for home too,\" she told him, believing it. \\nSer Jorah laughed. \"Look around you then, Khaleesi.\" \\nBut it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King\\'s Landing and the great Red Keep that Aegon the \\nConqueror had built. It was Dragonstone where she had been born. In her mind\\'s eye they burned with a \\nthousand lights, a fire blazing in every window. In her mind\\'s eye, all the doors were red. \\n\"My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,\" Dany said. She had known that for a long time, \\nshe realized. She had known it all her life. Only she had never let herself say the words, even in a \\nwhisper, but now she said them for Jorah Mormont and all the world to hear. \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 207 \\nSer Jorah gave her a measuring look. \"You think not.\" \\n\"He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,\" Dany said. \"He has no coin and the \\nonly knight who follows him reviles him as less than a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. \\nHe will never take us home.\" \\n\"Wise child.\" The knight smiled. \\n\"I am no child,\" she told him fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of her mount, rousing the silver to \\na gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and Irri and the others far behind, the warm wind in \\nher hair and the setting sun red on her face. By the time she reached the khalasar, it was dusk. \\nThe slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool. She could hear rough voices from the \\nwoven grass palace on the hill. Soon there would be laughter, when the men of her khas told the story of \\nwhat had happened in the grasses today. By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every \\nman, woman, and child in the camp would know him for a walker. There were no secrets in the khalasar. \\nDany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent. It was cool and dim beneath \\nthe silk. As she let the door flap close behind her, Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch \\nher dragon\\'s eggs across the tent. For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her \\neyes. She blinked, and they were gone. \\nPage 155\\n\\nStone, she told herself. They are only stone, even Illyrio said so, the dragons are all dead. She put her \\npalm against the black egg, fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell. The stone was warm. \\nAlmost hot. \"The sun,\" Dany whispered. \"The sun warmed them as they rode.\" \\nShe commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath. Doreah built a fire outside the tent, while Irri and \\nJhiqui fetched the big copper tub-another bride gift-from the packhorses and carried water from the \\npool. When the bath was steaming, Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her. \\n\"Have you ever seen a dragon?\" she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and Jhiqui sluiced sand from her \\nhair. She had heard that the first dragons had come from the east, from the Shadow Lands beyond \\nAsshai and the islands of the Jade Sea. Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild. \\n\"Dragons are gone, Khaleesi,\" Irri said. \\n\"Dead,\" agreed Jhiqui. \"Long and long ago.\" \\nViserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago, \\nduring the reign of Aegon 111, who \\nwas called the Dragonbane. That did not seem so long ago to Dany. \"Everywhere?\" she said, \\ndisappointed. \"Even in the east?\" Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell on Valyria and the \\nLands of the Long Summer, and neither spell-forged steel nor stormsingers nor dragons could hold it \\nback, but Dany had always heard that the east was different. It was said that manticores prowled the \\nislands of the Jade Sea, that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and \\naeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible \\nsorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn\\'t there be dragons too? \\n\"No dragon,\" Irri said. \"Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It is known.\" \\n\"It is known,\" agreed Jhiqui. \\n\"A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,\" blond Doreah said as she \\nwarmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves \\nwhen Drogo destroyed their father\\'s khalasar. Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had \\nfound her in a pleasure house in Lys. \\nSilvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. \"The moon?\" \\n\"He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi,\" the Lysene girl said. \"Once there were two moons in the \\nsky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons \\npoured forth, and drank the fire of the sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon \\nwill kiss the sun too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.\" \\nThe two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. \"You are foolish strawhead slave,\" Irri said. \"Moon is no \\negg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.\" \\n\"It is known,\" Jhiqui agreed. \\nPage 156\\n\\nDany\\'s skin was flushed and pink when she climbed from the tub. Jhiqui laid her down to oil her body \\nand scrape the dirt from her pores. Afterward Irri sprinkled her with spiceflower and cinnamon. While \\nDoreah brushed her hair until it shone like spun silver, she thought about the moon, and eggs, and \\ndragons. \\nHer supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread, with a jug of honeyed wine to wash it \\ndown. \"Doreah, stay and eat with me,\" Dany commanded when she sent her other handmaids away. The \\nLysene girl had hair the color of honey, and eyes like the summer sky. \\nShe lowered those eyes when they were alone. \"You honor me, Khaleesi, \" she said, but it was no \\nhonor, only service. Long after the moon had risen, they sat together, talking. \\nThat night, when Khal Drogo came, Dany was waiting for him. He stood in the door of her tent and \\nlooked at her with surprise. She rose slowly and opened her sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground. \\n\"This night we must go outside, my lord,\" she told him, for the Dothraki believed that all things of \\nimportance in a man\\'s life must be done beneath the open sky. \\nKhal Drogo followed her out into the moonlight, the bells in his hair tinkling softly. A few yards from her \\ntent was a bed of soft grass, and it was there that Dany drew him down. When he tried to turn her over, \\nshe put a hand on his chest. \"No,\" she said. \"This night I would look on your face.\" \\nThere is no privacy in the heart of the khalasar. Dany felt the eyes on her as she undressed him, heard \\nthe soft voices as she did the things that Doreah had told her to do. It was nothing to her. Was she not \\nkhaleesi? His were the only eyes that mattered, and when she mounted him she saw something there that \\nshe had never seen before. She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver, and when the \\nmoment of his pleasure came, Khal Drogo called out her name. \\nThey were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany\\'s stomach with \\nher fingers and said, \"Khaleesi, you are with child.\" \\n\"I know,\" Dany told her. \\nIt was her fourteenth name day. \\nBRAN \\nIn the yard below, Rickon ran with the wolves. \\nBran watched from his window seat. Wherever the boy went, \\nGrey Wind was there first, loping ahead to cut him off, until Rickon saw him, screamed in delight, and \\nwent pelting off in another direction. Shaggydog ran at his heels, spinning and snapping if the other wolves \\ncame too close. His fur had darkened until he was all black, and his eyes were green fire. Bran\\'s Summer \\ncame last. He was silver and smoke, with eyes of yellow gold that saw all there was to see. Smaller than \\nGrey Wind, and more wary. Bran thought he was the smartest of the litter. He could hear his brother\\'s \\nbreathless laughter as Rickon dashed across the hardpacked earth on little baby legs. \\nPage 157\\n\\nHis eyes stung. He wanted to be down there, laughing and running. Angry at the thought, Bran knuckled \\naway the tears before they could fall. His eighth name day had come and gone. He was almost a man \\ngrown now, too old to cry. \\n\"It was just a lie,\" he said bitterly, remembering the crow from his dream. \"I can\\'t fly. I can\\'t even run.\" \\n\"Crows are all liars,\" Old Nan agreed, from the chair where she sat doing her needlework. \"I know a \\nstory about a crow.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want any more stories,\" Bran snapped, his voice petulant. He had liked Old Nan and her stories \\nonce. Before. But it was different now. They left her with him all day now, to watch over him and \\nclean him and keep him from being lonely, but she just made it worse. \"I hate your stupid stories.\" \\nThe old woman smiled at him toothlessly. \"My stories? No, my little lord, not mine. The stories are, \\nbefore me and after me, before you too.\" \\nShe was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and wrinkled, almost blind, too weak \\nto climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew \\nhow old she was, but his father said she\\'d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the \\noldest person in Winterfell for certain, maybe the oldest person in the Seven Kingdoms. Nan had come \\nto the castle as a wet nurse for a Brandon Stark whose mother had died birthing him. He had been an \\nolder brother of Lord Rickard, Bran\\'s grandfather, or perhaps a younger brother, or a brother to Lord \\nRickard\\'s father. Sometimes Old Nan told it one way and sometimes another. In all the stories the little \\nboy died at three of a summer chill, but Old Nan stayed on at Winterfell with her own children. She had \\nlost both her sons to the war when King Robert won the throne, and her grandson was killed on the walls \\nof Pyke during Balon Greyjoy\\'s rebellion. Her daughters had long ago married and moved away and \\ndied. All that was left of her own blood was Hodor, the simpleminded giant who worked in the stables, \\nbut Old Nan just lived on and on, doing her needlework and telling her stories. \\n\"I don\\'t care whose stories they are,\" Bran told her, \"I hate them.\" He didn\\'t want stories and he didn\\'t \\nwant Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father. He wanted to go running with Summer loping beside \\nhim. He wanted to climb the broken tower and feed corn to the crows. He wanted to ride his pony again \\nwith his brothers. He wanted it to be the way it had been before. \\n\"I know a story about a boy who hated stories,\" Old Nan said with her stupid little smile, her needles \\nmoving all the while, click click click, until Bran was ready to scream at her. \\nIt would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him into flying, but when he \\nwoke up he was broken and the world was changed. They had all left him, his father and his mother and \\nhis sisters and even his bastard brother Jon. His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King\\'s \\nLanding, but they\\'d gone without him. Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with a message, \\nand another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall, but there had been no answers. \"Ofttimes the birds \\nare lost, child,\" the maester had told him. \"There\\'s many a mile and many a hawk between here and \\nKing\\'s Landing, the message may not have reached them.\" \\nYet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had slept ... or perhaps Bran had died, and they had \\nPage 158\\n\\nforgotten him. Jory and Ser Rodrik and Vayon Poole had gone too, and Hullen and Harwin and Fat Tom \\nand a quarter of the guard. \\nOnly Robb and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed. He was Robb the Lord now, or \\ntrying to be. He wore a real sword and never smiled. His days were spent drilling the guard and \\npracticing his swordplay, making the yard ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his \\nwindow. At night he closeted himself with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account books. \\nSometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time, visiting distant holdfasts. \\nWhenever he was away more than a day, Rickon would cry and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming \\nback. Even when he was home at Winterfell, Robb the Lord seemed to have more time for Hallis Mollen \\nand Theon Greyjoy than he ever did for his brothers. \\n\"I could tell you the story about Brandon the Builder,\" Old Nan said. \"That was always your favorite.\" \\nThousands and thousands of years ago, Brandon the Builder had raised Winterfell, and some said the \\nWall. Bran knew the story, but it had never been his favorite. Maybe one of the other Brandons had \\nliked that story. Sometimes Nan would talk to him as if he were her Brandon, the baby she had nursed all \\nthose years ago, and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon, who was killed by the Mad \\nKing before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother had told him once, that all the Brandon \\nStarks had become one person in her head. \\n\"That\\'s not my favorite,\" he said. \"My favorites were the scary ones.\" He heard some sort of commotion \\noutside and turned back to the window. Rickon was running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the \\nwolves following him, but the tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He \\nsmashed a fist on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing. \\n\"Oh, my sweet summer child,\" Old Nan said quietly, \"what do you know of fear? Fear is for the winter, \\nmy little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. \\nFear is for the long night, when the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and \\nlive and die all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers move \\nthrough the woods.\" \\n\"You mean the Others,\" Bran said querulously. \\n\"The Others,\" Old Nan agreed. \"Thousands and thousands of years \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 213 \\nago, a winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There came a night that \\nlasted a generation, and kings shivered and died in their castles even as the swineherds in their hovels. \\nWomen smothered their children rather than see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their \\ncheeks.\" Her voice and her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and \\nasked, \"So, child. This is the sort of story you like?\" \\n\"Well,\" Bran said reluctantly, \"yes, only . . . \\nOld Nan nodded. \"In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,\" she said as her needles went \\nclick click click. \"They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, \\nand every creature with hot blood in its veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled \\nheroes and armies by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the \\nswords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes found no pity in them. \\nPage 159\\n\\nThey hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their dead servants on the flesh of human children.\" \\nHer voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found himself leaning forward to listen. \\n\"Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the women fled across the narrow \\nsea from the cities of the Rhoyne, and the hundred kingdoms of those times were the kingdoms of the \\nFirst Men, who had taken these lands from the children of the forest. Yet here and there in the fastness of \\nthe woods the children still lived in their wooden cities and hollow hills, and the faces in the trees kept \\nwatch. So as cold and death filled the earth, the last hero determined to seek out the children, in the \\nhopes that their ancient magics could win back what the armies of men had lost. He set out into the dead \\nlands with a sword, a horse, a dog, and a dozen companions. For years he searched, until he despaired \\nof ever finding the children of the forest in their secret cities. One by one his friends died, and his horse, \\nand finally even his dog, and his sword froze so hard the blade snapped when he tried to use it. And the \\nOthers smelled the hot blood in him, and came silent on his trail, stalking him with packs of pale white \\nspiders big as hounds-\" \\nThe door opened with a bang, and Bran\\'s heart leapt up into his mouth in sudden fear, but it was only \\nMaester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway behind him. \"Hodor!\" the stableboy announced, as \\nwas his custom, smiling hugely at them all. \\nMaester Luwin was not smiling. \"We have visitors,\" he announced, \"and your presence is required, \\nBran.\" \\n\"I\\'m listening to a story now,\" Bran complained. \\n\"Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there they are,\" Old Nan said. \\n\"Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories of their own.\" \\n\"Who is it?\" Bran asked Maester Luwin. \\n\"Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night\\'s Watch, with word from your brother Jon. Robb is \\nmeeting with them now. Hodor, will you help Bran down to the hall?\" \\n\"Hodor!\" Hodor agreed happily. He ducked to get his great shaggy head under the door. Hodor was \\nnearly seven feet tall. It was hard to believe that he was the same blood as Old Nan. Bran wondered if \\nhe would shrivel up as small as his great-grandmother when he was old. It did not seem likely, even if \\nHodor lived to be a thousand. \\nHodor lifted Bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay, and cradled him against his massive chest. He \\nalways smelled faintly of horses, but it was not a bad smell. His arms were thick with muscle and matted \\nwith brown hair. \"Hodor,\" he said again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know \\nmuch, but no one could doubt that he knew his name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran told \\nher that, and confessed that Hodor\\'s real name was Walder. No one knew where \"Hodor\" had come \\nfrom, she said, but when he started saying it, they started calling him by it. It was the only word he had. \\nThey left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories. Hodor hummed tunelessly as \\nhe carried Bran down the steps and through the gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to \\nkeep up with the stableboy\\'s long strides. \\nPage 160\\n\\nRobb was seated in Father\\'s high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather and the stern face of Robb \\nthe Lord. Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind him. A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone \\nwalls beneath tall narrow windows. In the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants, and four \\nstrangers in the black of the Night\\'s Watch. Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that Hodor \\ncarried him through the doors. \\n\"Any man of the Night\\'s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as he wishes to stay,\" Robb \\nwas saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword was across his knees, the steel bare for all the \\nworld to see. Even Bran knew what it meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword. \\n\"Any man of the Night\\'s Watch,\" the dwarf repeated, \"but not me, do I take your meaning, boy?\" \\nRobb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword. \"I am the \\nlord here while my mother and father are away, Lannister. I am not your boy.\" \\n\"If you are a lord, you might learn a lord\\'s courtesy,\" the little man replied, ignoring the sword point in his \\nface. \"Your bastard brother has all your father\\'s graces, it would seem.\" \\n\"Jon, \" Bran gasped out from Hodor\\'s arms. \\nThe dwarf turned to look at him. \"So it is true, the boy lives. I could scarce believe it. You Starks are \\nhard to kill.\" \\n\"You Lannisters had best remember that,\" Robb said, lowering his sword. \"Hodor, bring my brother \\nhere.\" \\n\"Hodor,\" Hodor said, and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high seat of the Starks, where \\nthe Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they called themselves the Kings in the North. The \\nseat was cold stone, polished smooth by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on \\nthe ends of its massive arms. Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless legs dangling. The great seat made \\nhim feel half a baby. \\nRobb put a hand on his shoulder. \"You said you had business with Bran. Well, here he is, Lannister.\" \\nBran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister\\'s eyes. One was black and one was green, and both \\nwere looking at him, studying him, weighing him. \"I am told you were quite the climber, Bran,\" the little \\nman said at last. \"Tell me, how is it you happened to fall that day?\" \\n\"I never,\" Bran insisted. He never fell, never never never. \\n\"The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came before it,\" said Maester Luwin \\ngently. \\n\"Curious,\" said Tyrion Lannister. \\n\"My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,\" Robb said curtly. \"Do your business and be on \\nyour way.\" \\nPage 161\\n\\n\"I have a gift for you,\" the dwarf said to Bran. \"Do you like to ride, boy?\" \\nMaester Luwin came forward. \"My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs. He cannot sit a horse.\" \\n\"Nonsense,\" said Lannister. \"With the right horse and the right saddle, even a cripple can ride.\" \\nThe word was a knife through Bran\\'s heart. He felt tears come unbidden to his eyes. \"I\\'m not a cripple!\" \\n\"Then I am not a dwarf,\" the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth. \"My father will rejoice to hear it.\" \\nGreyjoy laughed. \\n\"What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?\" Maester Luwin asked. \\n\"A smart horse,\" Lannister replied. \"The boy cannot use his legs to \\ncommand the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, to the \\nvoice. I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be unlearned.\" He drew a rolled \\npaper from his belt. \"Give this to your saddler. He will provide the rest.\" \\nMaester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand, curious as a small grey squirrel. He unrolled it, \\nstudied it. \"I see. You draw nicely, my lord. Yes, this ought to work. I should have thought of this \\nmyself.\" \\n\"It came easier to me, Maester. It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.\" \\n\"Will I truly be able to ride?\" Bran asked. He wanted to believe them, but he was afraid. Perhaps it was \\njust another lie. The crow had promised him that he could fly. \\n\"You will,\" the dwarf told him. \"And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you will be as tall as any of \\nthem.\" \\nRobb Stark seemed puzzled. \"Is this some trap, Lannister? What\\'s Bran to you? Why should you want \\nto help him?\" \\n\"Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples and bastards and \\nbroken things.\" Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his heart and grinned. \\nThe door to the yard flew open. Sunlight came streaming across the hall as Rickon burst in, breathless. \\nThe direwolves were with him. The boy stopped by the door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on. Their \\neyes found Lannister, or perhaps they caught his scent. Summer began to growl first. Grey Wind picked \\nit up. They padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left. \\n\"The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,\" Theon Greyioy commented. \\n\"Perhaps it\\'s time I took my leave,\" Tyrion said. He took a step backward . . . and Shaggydog came out \\nof the shadows behind him, snarling. Lannister recoiled, and Summer lunged at him from the other side. \\nHe reeled away, unsteady on his feet, and Grey Wind snapped at his arm, teeth ripping at his sleeve and \\ntearing loose a scrap of cloth. \\nPage 162\\n\\n\"No!\" Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister\\'s men reached for their steel. \"Summer, here. \\nSummer, to me!\" \\nThe direwolf heard the voice, glanced at Bran, and again at Lannister. He crept backward, away from \\nthe little man, and settled down below Bran\\'s dangling feet. \\nRobb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and called, \"Grey Wind.\" His direwolf moved \\nto him, swift and silent. Now there was only Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, his eyes burning like \\ngreen fire. \\n\"Rickon, call him,\" Bran shouted to his baby brother, and Rickon remembered himself and screamed, \\n\"Home, Shaggy, home now.\" The black wolf gave Lannister one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon, \\nwho hugged him tightly around the neck. \\nTyrion Lannister undid his scarf, mopped at his brow, and said in a flat voice, \"How interesting.\" \\n\"Are you well, my lord?\" asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced nervously at the \\ndirewolves as he spoke. \\n\"My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was harmed save my dignity.\" \\nEven Robb looked shaken. \"The wolves . . . I don\\'t know why they did that . . .\" \\n\"No doubt they mistook me for dinner.\" Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran. \"I thank you for calling them off, \\nyoung ser. I promise you, they would have found me quite indigestible. And now I will be leaving, truly.\" \\n\"A moment, my lord,\" Maester Luwin said. He moved to Robb and they huddled close together, \\nwhispering. Bran tried to hear what they were saying, but their voices were too low. \\nRobb Stark finally sheathed his sword. \"I . . . I may have been hasty with you,\" he said. \"You\\'ve done \\nBran a kindness, and, well . . .\" Robb composed himself with an effort. \"The hospitality of Winterfell is \\nyours if you wish it, Lannister.\" \\n\"Spare me your false courtesies, boy. You do not love me and you do not want me here. I saw an inn \\noutside your walls, in the winter town. I\\'ll find a bed there, and both of us will sleep easier. For a few \\ncoppers I may even find a comely wench to warm the sheets for me.\" He spoke to one of the black \\nbrothers, an old man with a twisted back and a tangled beard. \"Yoren, we go south at daybreak. You \\nwill find me on the road, no doubt.\" With that he made his exit, struggling across the hall on his short legs, \\npast Rickon and out the door. His men followed. \\nThe four of the Night\\'s Watch remained. Robb turned to them uncertainly. \"I have had rooms prepared, \\nand you\\'ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust of the road. I hope you will honor us at table \\ntonight.\" He spoke the words so awkwardly that even Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned, \\nnot words from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same. \\nSummer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his bed. Old Nan was asleep \\nin her chair. Hodor said \"Hodor,\" gathered up his great-grandmother, and carried her off, snoring softly, \\nwhile Bran lay thinking. Robb had promised that he could feast with \\nPage 163\\n\\nthe Night\\'s Watch in the Great Hall. \"Summer,\" he called. The wolf bounded up on the bed. Bran \\nhugged him so hard he could feel the hot breath on his cheek. \"I can ride now,\" he whispered to his \\nfriend. \"We can go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.\" After a time he slept. \\nIn his dream he was climbing again, pulling himself up an ancient windowless tower, his fingers forcing \\nthemselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed, \\nthrough the clouds and into the night sky, and still the tower rose before him. When he paused to look \\ndown, his head swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping. Bran cried out and clung for dear life. The \\nearth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. He could not fly. He waited until his heart \\nhad stopped pounding, until he could breathe, and he began to climb again. There was no way to go but \\nup. Far above him, outlined against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. \\nHis arms were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The gargoyles \\nwatched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. Perhaps once they had been lions, \\nbut now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone \\nvoices terrible to hear. He must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear \\nthem he was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and padded down the \\nside of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe after all. \"I didn\\'t hear,\" he wept as they \\ncame closer and closer, \"I didn\\'t, I didn\\'t.\" \\nHe woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him. \"I didn\\'t hear,\" he \\nwhispered, trembling in fear, but then the shadow said \"Hodor,\" and lit the candle by the bedside, and \\nBran sighed with relief. \\nHodor washed the sweat from him with a warm, damp cloth and dressed him with deft and gentle hands. \\nWhen it was time, he carried him down to the Great Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near \\nthe fire. The lord\\'s seat at the head of the table had been left empty, but Robb sat to the right of it, with \\nBran across from him. They ate suckling pig that night, and pigeon pie, and turnips soaking in butter, and \\nafterward the cook had promised honeycombs. Summer snatched table scraps from Bran\\'s hand, while \\nGrey Wind and Shaggydog fought over a bone in the corner. Winterfell\\'s dogs would not come near the \\nhall now. Bran had found that strange at first, but he was growing used to it. \\nYoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him between Robb and Maester \\nLuwin. The old man had a sour \\nsmell, as if he had not washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the ribs to \\nsuck out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. \"Ser Alliser\\'s bane,\" he \\ngrunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did not understand. But when Robb asked \\nfor news of their uncle Benjen, the black brothers grew ominously quiet. \\n\"What is it?\" Bran asked. \\nYoren wiped his fingers on his vest. \"There\\'s hard news, m\\'lords, and a cruel way to pay you for your \\nmeat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear the answer. Stark\\'s gone.\" \\nOne of the other men said, \"The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar Royce, and he\\'s late \\nreturning, my lord.\" \\nPage 164\\n\\n\"Too long,\" Yoren said. \"Most like he\\'s dead.\" \\n\"My uncle is not dead,\" Robb Stark said loudly, anger in his tones. He rose from the bench and laid his \\nhand on the hilt of his sword. \"Do you hear me? My uncle is not dead!\" His voice rang against the stone \\nwalls, and Bran was suddenly afraid. \\nOld sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb, unimpressed. \"Whatever you say, m\\'lord,\" he said. He \\nsucked at a piece of meat between his teeth. \\nThe youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \"There\\'s not a man on the Wall \\nknows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark. He\\'ll find his way back.\" \\n\"Well,\" said Yoren, \"maybe he will and maybe he won\\'t. Good men have gone into those woods before, \\nand never come out.\" \\nAll Bran could think of was Old Nan\\'s story of the Others and the last hero, hounded through the white \\nwoods by dead men and spiders big as hounds. He was afraid for a moment, until he remembered how \\nthat story ended. \"The children will help him,\" he blurted, \"the children of the forest!\" \\nTheon Greyjoy sniggered, and Maester Luwin said, \"Bran, the children of the forest have been dead and \\ngone for thousands of years. All that is left of them are the faces in the trees.\" \\n\"Down here, might be that\\'s true, Maester,\" Yoren said, \"but up past the Wall, who\\'s to say? Up there, a \\nman can\\'t always tell what\\'s alive and what\\'s dead.\" \\nThat night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up to bed himself. Grey Wind led the \\nway, and Summer came close behind. His brother was strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a \\nbundle of rags, but the stairs were steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they \\nreached the top. \\nHe put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the \\ncandle. For a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not know \\nwhat to say. \"We\\'ll find a horse for you, I promise,\" Robb whispered at last. \\n\"Are they ever coming back?\" Bran asked him. \\n\"Yes,\" Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing his brother and not just \\nRobb the Lord. \"Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can ride out to meet her when she comes. \\nWouldn\\'t that surprise her, to see you ahorse?\" Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother\\'s \\nsmile. \"And afterward, we\\'ll ride north to see the Wall. We won\\'t even tell Jon we\\'re coming, we\\'ll just be \\nthere one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.\" \\n\"An adventure,\" Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room was so dark he could not \\nsee the tears on Robb\\'s face, so he reached out and found his hand. Their fingers twined together. \\nEDDARD \\nPage 165\\n\\n\"Lord Arryn\\'s death was a great sadness for all of us, my lord,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"I would be \\nmore than happy to tell you what I can of the manner of his passing. Do be seated. Would you care for \\nrefreshments? Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer agrees \\nwith my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened with honey. I find it most \\nrefreshing in this heat.\" \\nThere was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air \\ncovered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their \\nhot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be \\nfound. \"That would be most kind,\" Ned said, seating himself. \\nPycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently. A slender young serving girl \\nhurried into the solar. \"Iced milk for the King\\'s Hand and myself, if you would be so kind, child. Well \\nsweetened.\" \\nAs the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers together and rested his \\nhands on his stomach. \"The smallfolk say that the last year of summer is always the hottest. It is not so, \\nyet ofttimes it feels that way, does it not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.\" \\nThe heavy jeweled chain \\naround the old man\\'s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. \"To be sure, King Maekar\\'s summer \\nwas hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean \\nthat the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke \\nsuddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was fierce while it lasted. \\nOldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only by night. We would walk in the gardens by \\nthe river and argue about the gods. I remember the smells of those nights, my lord-perfume and sweat, \\nmelons ripe to bursting, peaches and pomegranates, nightshade and moonbloom. I was a young man \\nthen, still forging my chain. The heat did not exhaust me as it does now.\" Pycelle\\'s eyes were so heavily \\nlidded he looked half-asleep. \"My pardons, Lord Eddard. You did not come to hear foolish meanderings \\nof a summer forgotten before your father was born. Forgive an old man his wanderings, if you would. \\nMinds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust. Ah, and here is our milk.\" The serving girl \\nplaced the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. \"Sweet child.\" He lifted a cup, tasted, \\nnodded. \"Thank you. You may go.\" \\nWhen the girl had taken her leave, Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, rheumy eyes. \"Now where were \\nwe? Oh, yes. You asked about Lord Arryn . . .\" \\n\"I did.\" Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold, but oversweet to his taste. \\n\"If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,\" Pycelle said. \"We had sat \\ntogether on council many a year, he and 1, and the signs were there to read, but I put them down to the \\ngreat burdens he had borne so faithfully for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all \\nthe cares of the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious that she \\nwould scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a strong man, and the Lord Jon \\nwas not young. Small wonder if he seemed melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I \\nam less certain.\" He gave a ponderous shake of his head. \\n\"What can you tell me of his final illness?\" \\nPage 166\\n\\nThe Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. \"He came to me one day asking \\nafter a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though it did seem to me that something was troubling \\nhim deeply. The next morning he was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon \\nthought it was a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, which \\ncan upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him myself, but the gods did not \\ngrant me the power to save him.\" \\n\"I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.\" \\nThe Grand Maester\\'s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. \"I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will \\nnever forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a \\nson to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do \\nnot comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and \\npepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.\" \\n\"Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?\" \\nPycelle wrinkled his brow. \"In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out the name Robert several \\ntimes, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit \\nthe boy to enter the sickroom, for fear that he too might be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat \\nbeside the bed for hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon\\'s spirits. His \\nlove was fierce to see.\" \\n\"Was there nothing else? No final words?\" \\n\"When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand the milk of the poppy, so he should not suffer. Just \\nbefore he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a \\nblessing for his son. The seed is strong, he said. At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend. \\nDeath did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.\" \\nNed took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it. \"Did it seem to you that there \\nwas anything unnatural about Lord Arryn\\'s death?\" \\n\"Unnatural?\" The aged maester\\'s voice was thin as a whisper. \"No, I could not say so. Sad, for a \\ncertainty. Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing of all, Lord Eddard. Jon Arryn rests easy \\nnow, his burdens lifted at last.\" \\n\"This illness that took him,\" said Ned. \"Had you ever seen its like before, in other men?\" \\n\"Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,\" Pycelle replied. \"Under our \\ngood King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, \\nand even for a few short months under Jaehaerys\\'s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name. I \\nhave seen more of illness than I care to remember, my lord. I will tell you this: Every case is different, and \\nevery case is alike. Lord Jon\\'s death was no stranger than any other.\" \\n224 GEORGE RA. MARTIN \\nPage 167\\n\\n\"His wife thought otherwise.\" \\nThe Grand Maester nodded. \"I recall now, the widow is sister to your own noble wife. If an old man \\nmay be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can derange even the strongest and most \\ndisciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was never that. Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in \\nevery shadow, and the death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.\" \\n\"So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?\" \\n\"I am,\" Pycelle replied gravely. \"If not illness, my good lord, what else could it be?\" \\n\"Poison,\" Ned suggested quietly. \\nPycelle\\'s sleepy eyes flicked open. The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in his seat. \"A disturbing \\nthought. We are not the Free Cities, where such things are common. Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote \\nthat all men carry murder in their hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.\" He fell silent for \\na moment, his eyes lost in thought. \"What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it likely. \\nEvery hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed none of the signs. And the \\nHand was loved by all. What sort of monster in man\\'s flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?\" \\n\"I have heard it said that poison is a woman\\'s weapon.\" \\nPycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully. \"It is said. Women, cravens . . . and eunuchs.\" He cleared his \\nthroat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes. Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery. \\n\"The Lord Varys was born a slave in Lys, did you know? Put not your trust in spiders, my lord.\" \\nThat was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about Varys that made his flesh \\ncrawl. \"I will remember that, Maester. And I thank you for your help. I have taken enough of your time.\" \\nHe stood. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted Ned to the door. \"I hope I \\nhave helped in some small way to put your mind at ease. If there is any other service I might perform, you \\nneed only ask.\" \\n\"One thing,\" Ned told him. \"I should be curious to examine the book that you lent Jon the day before he \\nfell ill.\" \\n\"I fear you would find it of little interest,\" Pycelle said. \"It was a ponderous tome by Grand Maester \\nMalleon on the lineages of the great houses.\" \\n\"Still, I should like to see it.\" \\nThe old man opened the door. \"As you wish. I have it here some- \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 225 \\nwhere. When I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.,, \\n\"You have been most courteous,\" Ned told him. Then, almost as an afterthought, he said, \"One last \\nquestion, if you would be so kind. You mentioned that the king was at Lord Arryn\\'s bedside when he \\ndied. I wonder, was the queen with him?\" \\nPage 168\\n\\n\"Why, no,\" Pycelle said. \"She and the children were making the journey to Casterly Rock, in company \\nwith her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name \\nday, no doubt hoping to see his son Jaime win the champion\\'s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. \\nIt fell to me to send the queen word of Lord Arryn\\'s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird with a \\nheavier heart.\" \\n\"Dark wings, dark words,\" Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had taught him as a boy. \\n\"So the fishwives say,\" Grand Maester Pycelle agreed, \"but we know it is not always so. When Maester \\nLuwin\\'s bird brought the word about your Bran, the message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it \\nnot?\" \\n\"As you say, Maester.\" \\n\"The gods are merciful.\" Pycelle bowed his head. \"Come to me as often as you like, Lord Eddard. I am \\nhere to serve.\" \\nYes, Ned thought as the door swung shut, but whom? \\nOn the way back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the winding steps of the Tower \\nof the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to balance on one leg. The rough stone had scuffed \\nher bare feet. Ned stopped and looked at her. \"Arya, what are you doing?\" \\n\"Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.\" Her hands flailed at the air to steady herself. \\nNed had to smile. \"Which toe?\" he teased. \\n\"Any toe,\" Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her right leg to her left, swaying \\ndangerously before she regained her balance. \\n\"Must you do your standing here?\" he asked. \"It\\'s a long hard fall down these steps.\" \\n\"Syrio says a water dancer never falls.\" She lowered her leg to stand on two feet. \"Father, will Bran \\ncome and live with us now?\" \\n\"Not for a long time, sweet one,\" he told her. \"He needs to win his strength back.\" \\nArya bit her lip. \"What will Bran do when he\\'s of age?\" \\nNed knelt beside her. \"He has years to find that answer, Arya. For \\nnow, it is enough to know that he will live.\" The night the bird had come from Winterfell, Eddard Stark \\nhad taken the girls to the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder and black cottonwood overlooking \\nthe river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; they \\nknelt before it to offer their thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon \\nrose, Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under Ned\\'s cloak. All through the dark hours he \\nkept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, the dark red blooms of dragon\\'s breath surrounded \\nthe girls where they lay. \"I dreamed of Bran,\" Sansa had whispered to him. \"I saw him smiling.\" \\nPage 169\\n\\n\"He was going to be a knight,\" Arya was saying now. \"A knight of the Kingsguard. Can he still be a \\nknight?\" \\n\"No,\" Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. \"Yet someday he may be the lord of a great holdfast and \\nsit on the king\\'s council. He might raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset \\nSea, or enter your mother\\'s Faith and become the High Septon.\" But he will never run beside his wolf \\nagain, he thought with a sadness too deep for words, or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his \\narms. \\nArya cocked her head to one side. \"Can I be a king\\'s councillor and build castles and become the High \\nSepton?\" \\n\"You,\" Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, \"will marry a king and rule his castle, and your sons will \\nbe knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps even a High Septon.\" \\nArya screwed up her face. \"No,\" she said, \"that\\'s Sansa.\" She folded up her right leg and resumed her \\nbalancing. Ned sighed and left her there. \\nInside his chambers, he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold water over his head from the \\nbasin beside the bed. Alyn entered as he was drying his face. \"My lord,\" he said, \"Lord Baelish is without \\nand begs audience.\" \\n\"Escort him to my solar,\" Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest linen he could find. \"I\\'ll see him \\nat once.\" \\nLittlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the knights of the Kingsguard \\npractice at swords in the yard below. \"If only old Selmy\\'s mind were as nimble as his blade,\" he said \\nwistfully, \"our council meetings would be a good deal livelier.\" \\n\"Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King\\'s Landing.\" Ned had come to have a deep \\nrespect for the aged, whitehaired Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. \\n\"And as tiresome,\" Littlefinger added, \"though I daresay he should \\ndo well in the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and it was only four years ago that he was \\nchampion.\" \\nThe question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the least. \"Is there a reason for \\nthis visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the view from my window?\" \\nLittlefinger smiled. \"I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so I have.\" \\nThat took Ned aback. Promise or no promise, he could not find it in him to trust Lord Petyr Baelish, \\nwho struck him as too clever by half. \"You have something for me?\" \\n\"Someone,\" Littlefinger corrected. \"Four someones, if truth be told. Had you thought to question the \\nHand\\'s servants?\" \\nPage 170\\n\\nNed frowned. \"Would that I could. Lady Arryn took her household back to the Eyrie.\" Lysa had done \\nhim no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest to her husband had gone with her when she \\nfled: Jon\\'s maester, his steward, the captain of his guard, his knights and retainers. \\n\"Most of her household,\" Littlefinger said, \"not all. A few remain. A pregnant kitchen girl hastily wed to \\none of Lord Renly\\'s grooms, a stablehand who joined the City Watch, a potboy discharged from service \\nfor theft, and Lord Arryn\\'s squire.\" \\n\"His squire?\" Ned was pleasantly surprised. A man\\'s squire often knew a great deal of his comings and \\ngoings. \\n\"Ser Hugh of the Vale,\" Littlefinger named him. \"The king knighted the boy after Lord Arryn\\'s death.\" \\n\"I shall send for him,\" Ned said. \"And the others.\" \\nLittlefinger winced. \"My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be so kind.\" \\n\"Why?\" \\n\"Come, and I\\'ll show you, my lord.\" \\nFrowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture. \"There, across the yard, at \\nthe door of the armory, do you see the boy squatting by the steps honing a sword with an oilstone?\" \\n\"What of him?\" \\n\"He reports to Varys. The Spider has taken a great interest in you and all your doings.\" He shifted in the \\nwindow seat. \"Now glance at the wall. Farther west, above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the \\nramparts?\" \\nNed saw the man. \"Another of the eunuch\\'s whisperers?\" \\n\"No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the door to this tower, the better \\nto note who calls on you. \\nThere are others, many unknown even to me. The Red Keep is full of eyes. Why do you think I hid Cat \\nin a brothel?\" \\nEddard Stark had no taste for these intrigues. \"Seven hells,\" he swore. It did seem as though the man on \\nthe wahs was watching him. Suddenly uncomfortable, Ned moved away from the window. \"Is everyone \\nsomeone\\'s informer in this cursed city?\" \\n\"Scarcely,\" said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. \"Why, there\\'s me, you, the king . . . \\nalthough, come to think on it, the king tells the queen much too much, and I\\'m less than certain about \\nyou.\" He stood up. \"Is there a man in your service that you trust utterly and completely?\" \\n\"Yes,\" said Ned. \\n\"In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to sell you,\" Littlefinger said \\nPage 171\\n\\nwith a mocking smile. \"The wiser answer was no, my lord, but be that as it may. Send this paragon of \\nyours to Ser Hugh and the others. Your own comings and goings will be noted, but even Varys the \\nSpider cannot watch every man in your service every hour of the day.\" He started for the door. \\n\"Lord Petyr,\" Ned called after him. \"I . . . am grateful for your help. Perhaps I was wrong to distrust \\nyou.\" \\nLittlefinger fingered his small pointed beard. \"You are slow to learn, Lord Eddard. Distrusting me was \\nthe wisest thing you\\'ve done since you climbed down off your horse.\" \\nJON \\nJon was showing Dareon how best to deliver a sidestroke when the new recruit entered the practice \\nyard. \"Your feet should be farther apart,\" he urged. \"You don\\'t want to lose your balance. That\\'s good. \\nNow pivot as you deliver the stroke, get all your weight behind the blade.\" \\nDareon broke off and lifted his visor. \"Seven gods,\" he murmured. \"Would you look at this, Jon.\" \\nJon turned. Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had ever seen standing in the \\ndoor of the armory. By the look of him, he must have weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his \\nembroidered surcoat was lost beneath his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a \\nface, and plump sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. \"They . . . they told me I \\nwas to come here for . . . for training,\" he said to no one in particular. \\n\"A lordling,\" Pyp observed to Jon. \"Southron, most like near Highgarden.\" Pyp had traveled the Seven \\nKingdoms with a mummers\\' troupe, and bragged that he could tell what you were and where you\\'d been \\nborn just from the sound of your voice. \\nA striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the fat boy\\'s fur-trimmed \\nsurcoat. Jon did not recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne looked over his new charge and said, \"It \\nwould seem they have run short of poachers and thieves down south. \\nNow they send us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?\" \\nIt was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; padded doublet, boiled \\nleather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-leather shield blazoned with the same striding \\nhuntsman he wore on his surcoat. As none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip \\nhimself from the armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a mail \\nhauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his head the armorer had to \\ndetach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his legs and under his arms that he could scarcely \\nmove. Dressed for battle, the new boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. \"Let us \\nhope you are not as inept as you look,\" Ser Alliser said. \"Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.\" \\nJon Snow winced. Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a stonemason. He was sixteen, \\ntall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any Jon had ever felt. \"This will be uglier than a whore\\'s \\nass,\" Pyp muttered, and it was. \\nPage 172\\n\\nThe fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his whole body shaking as \\nblood leaked through his shattered helm and between his pudgy fingers. \"I yield,\" he shrilled. \"No more, I \\nyield, don\\'t hit me.\" Rast and some of the other boys were laughing. \\nEven then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. \"On your feet, Ser Piggy,\" he called. \"Pick up your sword.\" \\nWhen the boy continued to cling to the ground, Thorne gestured to Halder. \"Hit him with the flat of your \\nblade until he finds his feet.\" Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe\\'s upraised cheeks. \"You can hit \\nharder than that,\" Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both hands and brought it \\ndown so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat. The new boy screeched in pain. \\nJon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. \"Jon, no,\" the small boy whispered \\nwith an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne. \\n\"On your feet,\" Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and fell heavily again. \"Ser Piggy \\nis starting to grasp the notion,\" Ser Alliser observed. \"Again.\" \\nHalder lifted the sword for another blow. \"Cut us off a ham!\" Rast urged, laughing. \\nJon shook off Pyp\\'s hand. \"Halder, enough.\" \\nHalder looked to Ser Alliser. \\n\"The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,\" the master-at-arms \\nsaid in that sharp, cold voice of his. \"I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord Snow.\" \\n\"Look at him, Haider,\" Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. \"There\\'s no honor in beating a fallen \\nfoe. He yielded.\" He knelt beside the fat boy. \\nHaider lowered his sword. \"He yielded,\" he echoed. \\nSer Alliser\\'s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. \"It would seem our Bastard is in love,\" he said as Jon \\nhelped the fat boy to his feet. \"Show me your steel, Lord Snow.\" \\nJon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he feared he was well beyond it \\nnow. \\nThorne smiled. \"The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make an exercise of it. Rat, \\nPimple, help our Stone Head here.\" Rast and Albett moved to join Haider. \"Three of you ought to be \\nsufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All you need do is get past the Bastard.\" \\n\"Stay behind me,\" Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes against him, but never \\nthree. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and bloody tonight. He braced himself for the assault. \\nSuddenly Pyp was beside him. \"Three to two will make for better sport,\" the small boy said cheerfully. \\nHe dropped his visor and slid out his sword. Before Jon could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped \\nup to make a third. \\nThe yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser\\'s eyes. \"Why are you waiting?\" he asked \\nPage 173\\n\\nRast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it was Jon who moved first. Haider barely got \\nhis sword up in time. \\nJon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on the heels. Know your \\nfoe, Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Haider, brutally strong but short of patience, with no \\ntaste for defense. Frustrate him, and he would leave himself open, as certain as sunset. \\nThe clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around him. Jon blocked a savage \\ncut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm as the swords crashed together. He slammed a \\nsidestroke into Haider\\'s ribs, and was rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain. The counterstroke caught \\nJon on the shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Haider was \\nunbalanced. Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a crash. \\nGrenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than he cared for, but Pyp was \\nhard-pressed. Rast had two years \\n232 \\nGEORGE R.R. MARTIN \\nand forty pounds on him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper\\'s helm like a bell. As Rast went \\nreeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his throat. By then Jon \\nhad moved on. Facing two swords, Albett backed away. \"I yield,\" he shouted. \\nSer Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. \"The mummer\\'s farce has gone on long enough for \\ntoday.\" He walked away. The session was at an end. \\nDareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman\\'s son wrenched off his helm and threw it across the \\nyard. \"For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.\" \\n\"For an instant, you did,\" Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder was throbbing. He \\nsheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he raised his arm, the pain made him grit his \\nteeth. \\n\"Let me,\" a voice said. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget and lifted it off gently. \"Did he \\nhurt you?\" \\n\"I\\'ve been bruised before.\" He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard was emptying around them. \\nBlood matted the fat boy\\'s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. \"My name is Samwell Tarly, of \\nHorn . . .\" He stopped and licked his lips. \"I mean, I was of Horn Hill, until I . . . left. I\\'ve come to take \\nthe black. My father is Lord Randyll, a bannerman to the \\nTyrells of Highgarden. I used to be his heir, only His voice \\ntrailed off. \\n\"I\\'m Jon Snow, Ned Stark\\'s bastard, of Winterfell.\" \\nSamwell Tarly nodded. \"I \\nPage 174\\n\\nMy mother calls me Sam.\" \\n\"You can call him Lord Snow,\" Pyp said as he came up to join them. \"You don\\'t want to know what his \\nmother calls him.\" \\n\"These two are Grenn and Pypar,\" Jon said. \\n\"Grenn\\'s the ugly one,\" Pyp said. \\nGrenn scowled. \"You\\'re uglier than me. At least I don\\'t have ears like a bat.\" \\n\"My thanks to all of you,\" the fat boy said gravely. \\n\"Why didn\\'t you get up and fight?\" Grenn demanded. \\n\"I wanted to, truly. I just . . . I couldn\\'t. I didn\\'t want him to hit me anymore.\" He looked at the ground. \\n\"I \\nMy lord father always said so.\" \\nGrenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp had words for everything. \\nWhat sort of man would proclaim himself a coward? \\nSamwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. His eyes \\n. if you want, you can call me Sam. \\nI fear I\\'m a coward. \\nmet Jon\\'s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. \"I ... I\\'m sorry,\" he said. \"I don\\'t mean to . . . to \\nbe like I am.\" He walked heavily toward the armory. \\nJon called after him. \"You were hurt,\" he said. \"Tomorrow you\\'ll do better.\" \\nSam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. \"No I won\\'t,\" he said, blinking back tears. \"I never do \\nbetter.\" \\nWhen he was gone, Grenn frowned. \"Nobody likes cravens,\" he said uncomfortably. \"I wish we hadn\\'t \\nhelped him. What if they think we\\'re craven too?\" \\n\"You\\'re too stupid to be craven,\" Pyp told him. \\n\"I am not,\" Grenn said. \\n\"Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you\\'d be too stupid to run away.\" \\n\"I would not,\" Grenn insisted. \"I\\'d run away faster than you.\" He stopped suddenly, scowling when he \\nsaw Pyp\\'s grin and realized what he\\'d just said. His thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there \\narguing as he returned to the armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor. \\nPage 175\\n\\nLife at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for swordplay, the afternoons for \\nwork. The black brothers set new recruits to many different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon \\ncherished the rare afternoons when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for \\nthe Lord Commander\\'s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal Noye in the \\narmory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened axes grown dull from use, or \\npumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, \\nmucked out stables, fletched arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his \\ncounts and inventories. \\nThat afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four barrels of fresh-crushed \\nstone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. It was lonely and boring work, even with \\nGhost along for company, but Jon found he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world \\nfrom the top of the Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing. He could think here, and he found \\nhimself thinking of Samwell Tarly . . . and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered what Tyrion would \\nhave made of the fat boy. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, the dwarf had told him, \\ngrinning. The world was full of cravens who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to \\nadmit to cowardice as Samwell Tarly had. \\nHis sore shoulder made the work go slowly. It was late afternoon before Jon finished graveling the \\npaths. He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning the western sky the color of blood. Finally, \\nas dusk was settling over the north, Jon rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the \\nwinch men to lower him. \\nThe evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the common hall. A group of the \\nblack brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the fire. His friends were at the bench nearest the west \\nwall, laughing. Pyp was in the middle of a story. The mummer\\'s boy with the big ears was a born liar with \\na hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing all the parts as \\nneeded, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin \\nprincess, he used a high falsetto voice that reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs \\nwere always eerily accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser. Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp\\'s antics as \\nanyone . . . yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, where Samwell Tarly \\nsat alone, as far from the others as he could get. \\nHe was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper when Jon sat down across \\nfrom him. The fat boy\\'s eyes widened at the sight of Ghost. \"Is that a wolf?\" \\n\"A direwolf,\" Jon said. \"His name is Ghost. The direwolf is the sigil of my father\\'s House.\" \\n\"Ours is a striding huntsman,\" Samwell Tarly said. \\n\"Do you like to hunt?\" \\nThe fat boy shuddered. \"I hate it.\" He looked as though he was going to cry again. \\n\"What\\'s wrong now?\" Jon asked him. \"Why are you always so frightened?\" \\nSam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too scared even to talk. A \\nburst of laughter filled the hall. Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a high voice. He stood. \"Let\\'s go outside.\" \\nPage 176\\n\\nThe round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. \"Why? What will we do outside?\" \\n\"Talk,\" Jon said. \"Have you seen the Wall?\" \\n\"I\\'m fat, not blind,\" Samwell Tarly said. \"Of course I saw it, it\\'s seven hundred feet high.\" Yet he stood \\nup all the same, wrapped a furlined cloak over his shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still \\nwary, as if he suspected some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night. Ghost padded along beside \\nthem. \"I never thought it would be like this,\" Sam said as they walked, his words steaming in the \\nA GAML OF THRONFS 235 \\ncold air. Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up. \"All the buildings are falling down, \\nand it\\'s so . . . so . . .\" \\n\"Cold?\" A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft crunch of grey weeds \\nbeneath his boots. \\nSam nodded miserably. \"I hate the cold,\" he said. \"Last night I woke up in the dark and the fire had gone \\nout and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by morning.\" \\n\"It must have been warmer where you come from.\" \\n\"I never saw snow until last month. We were crossing the barrowlands, me and the men my father sent \\nto see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a soft rain. At first I thought it was so beautiful, like \\nfeathers drifting from the sky, but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of \\nsnow in their beards and more on their shoulders, and still it kept coming. I was afraid it would never \\nend.\" \\nJon smiled. \\nThe Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half moon. In the sky above, the stars \\nburned clear and sharp. \"Are they going to make me go up there?\" Sam asked. His face curdled like old \\nmilk as he looked at the great wooden stairs. \"I\\'ll die if I have to climb that.\" \\n\"There\\'s a winch,\" Jon said, pointing. \"They can draw you up in a cage.\" \\nSamwell Tarly sniffled. \"I don\\'t like high places.\" \\nIt was too much. Jon frowned, incredulous. \"Are you afraid of everything?\" he asked. \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand. If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why would a coward want to join the Night\\'s \\nWatch?\" \\nSamwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to cave in on itself. He sat \\ndown on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge choking sobs that made his whole body \\nshake. Jon Snow could only stand and watch. Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears \\nwould never end. \\nIt was Ghost who knew what to do. Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved closer and began to lick \\nthe warm tears off Samwell Tarly\\'s face. The fat boy cried out, startled . . . and somehow, in a heartbeat, \\nhis sobs turned to laughter. \\nPage 177\\n\\nJon Snow laughed with him. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled in their cloaks with Ghost \\nbetween them. Jon told the story of how he and Robb had found the pups newborn in the late summer \\nsnows. It seemed a thousand years ago now. Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell. \\n\"Sometimes I dream about it,\" he said. \"I\\'m walking down this long empty hall. My voice echoes all \\naround, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening doors, shouting names. I don\\'t even know who I\\'m \\nlooking for. Most nights it\\'s my father, but sometimes it\\'s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my \\nuncle.\" The thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear had sent out \\nrangers in search of him. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and Quorin Halfhand had gone forth \\nfrom the Shadow Tower, but they\\'d found nothing aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had \\nleft to mark his way. In the stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of \\nBen Stark vanished. \\n\"Do you ever find anyone in your dream?\" Sam asked. \\nJon shook his head. \"No one. The castle is always empty.\" He had never told anyone of the dream, and \\nhe did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet somehow it felt good to talk of it. \"Even the \\nravens are gone from the rookery, and the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run \\nthen, throwing open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for anyone. \\nAnd then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It\\'s black inside, and I can see the steps spiraling \\ndown. Somehow I know I have to go down there, but I don\\'t want to. I\\'m afraid of what might be \\nwaiting for me. The old Kings of Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their \\nfeet and iron swords across their laps, but it\\'s not them I\\'m afraid of. I scream that I\\'m not a Stark, that \\nthis isn\\'t my place, but it\\'s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start down, feeling the walls as I descend, \\nwith no torch to light the way. It gets darker and darker, until I want to scream.\" He stopped, frowning, \\nembarrassed. \"That\\'s when I always wake.\" His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his \\ncell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He would go back to sleep \\nwith his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. \"Do you dream of Horn Hill?\" Jon asked. \\n\"No.\" Sam\\'s mouth grew tight and hard. \"I hated it there.\" He scratched Ghost behind the ear, brooding, \\nand Jon let the silence breathe. After a long while Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened \\nquietly, and learned how it was that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall. \\nThe Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of Highgarden and Warden of \\nthe South. The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and \\na storied two-handed greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of \\nValyrian steel and passed down from father to son near five hundred years. \\nWhatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell\\'s birth vanished as the boy grew up plump, \\nsoft, and awkward. Sam loved to listen to music and make his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in \\nthe castle kitchen beside the cooks, drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry \\ntarts. His passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at the sight of \\nblood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered. A dozen mastersat-arms came and went at Horn \\nHill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and \\nstarved. One man had him sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his \\nPage 178\\n\\nmother\\'s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He only grew fatter and \\nmore frightened, until Lord Randyll\\'s disappointment turned to anger and then to loathing. \"One time,\" \\nSam confided, his voice dropping from a whisper, \"two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth \\nwith white skin and blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but it \\ndidn\\'t make me brave as they\\'d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them scourged.\" \\nFinally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a second son. From that \\nday, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to \\nhis liking. Samwell had known several years of sweet peace with his music and his books. \\nUntil The dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find his horse saddled and \\nready. Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a \\ndeer. \"You are almost a man grown now, and my heir,\" Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his \\nlong knife laying bare the carcass as he spoke. \"You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither \\nwill I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon\\'s. Heartsbane must go to a man strong \\nenough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her hilt. So I have decided that you shall this day \\nannounce that you wish to take the black. You will forsake all claim to your brother\\'s inheritance and \\nstart north before evenfall. \\n\"If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in these woods your horse will \\nstumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to die . . . or so I will tell your mother. She has a \\nwoman\\'s heart and finds it in her to cherish even you, and I have no wish to cause her pain. Please do not \\nimagine that it will truly be \\nthat easy, should you think to defy me. Nothing would please me more than to hunt you down like the \\npig you are.\" His arms were red to the elbow as he laid the skinning knife aside. \"So. There is your \\nchoice. The Night\\'s Watch\"-he reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and \\ndripping-\"or this.\" \\nSam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had happened to someone else, not \\nto him. And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, not even once. When he was done, they sat \\ntogether and listened to the wind for a time. There was no other sound in all the world. \\nFinally Jon said, \"We should go back to the common hall.\" \\n\"Why?\" Sam asked. \\nJon shrugged. \"There\\'s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer. Some nights Dareon sings for us, \\nif the mood is on him. He was a singer, before . . . well, not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.\" \\n\"How did he come here?\" Sam asked. \\n\"Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter. The girl was two years older, and \\nDareon swears she helped him through her window, but under her father\\'s eye she named it rape, so here \\nhe is. When Maester Aemon heard him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder.\" Jon \\nsmiled. \"Toad sometimes sings too, if you call it singing. Drinking songs he learned in his father\\'s winesink. \\nPyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.\" They laughed at that together. \\n\"I should like to hear them both,\" Sam admitted, \"but they would not want me there.\" His face was \\nPage 179\\n\\ntroubled. \"He\\'s going to make me fight again on the morrow, isn\\'t he?\" \\n\"He is,\" Jon was forced to say. \\nSam got awkwardly to his feet. \"I had better try to sleep.\" He huddled down in his cloak and plodded \\noff. \\nThe others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for Ghost. \"Where haveyou \\nbeen?\" Pyp asked. \\n\"Talking with Sam,\" he said. \\n\"He truly is craven,\" said Grenn. \"At supper, there were still places on the bench when he got his pie, but \\nhe was too scared to come sit with us.\" \\n\"The Lord of Ham thinks he\\'s too good to eat with the likes of us,\" suggested Jeren. \\n\"I saw him eat a pork pie,\" Toad said, smirking. \"Do you think it was a brother?\" He began to make \\noinking noises. \\n\"Stop it!\" Jon snapped angrily. \\nThe other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury. \"Listen to \\nme,\" Jon said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as he\\'d known \\nhe would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn was anxious at the first, but Jon \\nknew the words to move him. One by one the rest fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, \\nshamed the others, made threats where threats were required. At the end they had all agreed . . . all but \\nRast. \\n\"You girls do as you please,\" Rast said, \"but if Thorne sends me against Lady Piggy, I\\'m going to slice \\nme off a rasher of bacon.\" He laughed in Jon\\'s face and left them there. \\nHours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held his arms while Pyp sat on \\nhis legs. Jon could hear Rast\\'s rapid breathing as Ghost leapt onto his chest. The direwolf\\'s eyes burned \\nred as embers as his teeth nipped lightly at the soft skin of the boy\\'s throat, just enough to draw blood. \\n\"Remember, we know where you sleep,\" Jon said softly. \\nThe next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had slipped while he shaved. \\nFrom that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell Tarly. When Ser Alliser \\nmatched them against him, they would stand their ground and swat aside his slow, clumsy strokes. If the \\nmaster-at-arms screamed for an attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm \\nor leg. Ser Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet Sam \\nremained unhurt. A few nights later, at Jon\\'s urging, he joined them for the evening meal, taking a place \\non the bench beside Halder. It was another fortnight before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in \\ntime he was laughing at Pyp\\'s faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them. \\nFat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. One night he visited Jon in \\nPage 180\\n\\nhis cell. \"I don\\'t know what you did,\" he said, \"but I know you did it.\" He looked away shyly. \"I\\'ve never \\nhad a friend before.\" \\n\"We\\'re not friends,\" Jon said. He put a hand on Sam\\'s broad shoulder. \"We\\'re brothers.\" \\nAnd so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave. Robb and Bran and Rickon were \\nhis father\\'s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn \\nStark had seen to that. The grey walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his \\nlife now, and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs who wore \\nthe black of the Night\\'s Watch. \\n\"My uncle spoke truly,\" he whispered to Ghost. He wondered if he would ever see Benjen Stark again, \\nto tell him. \\nEDDARD \\n\"\\'It\\'s the Hand\\'s tourney that\\'s the cause of all the trouble, my lords,\" the Commander of the City Watch \\ncomplained to the king\\'s council. \\n\"The king\\'s tourney,\" Ned corrected, wincing. \"I assure you, the Hand wants no part of it.\" \\n\"Call it what you will, my lord. Knights have been arriving from all over the realm, and for every knight \\nwe get two freeriders, three craftsmen, six men-at-arms, a dozen merchants, two dozen whores, and \\nmore thieves than I dare guess. This cursed heat had half the city in a fever to start, and now with all \\nthese visitors . . . last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two fires, \\nrobberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the Sisters. The night before a \\nwoman\\'s head was found in the Great Sept, floating in the rainbow pool. No one seems to know how it \\ngot there or who it belongs to.\" \\n\"How dreadful,\" Varys said with a shudder. \\nLord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic. \"If you cannot keep the king\\'s peace, Janos, perhaps the \\nCity Watch should be commanded by someone who can.\" \\nStout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog, his bald pate reddening. \"Aegon the \\nDragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I need more men.\" \\n\"How many?\" Ned asked, leaning forward. As ever, Robert had not troubled himself to attend the \\ncouncil session, so it fell to his Hand to speak for him. \\n\"As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.\" \\n\"Hire fifty new men,\" Ned told him. \"Lord Baelish will see that you get the coin.\" \\n\"I will?\" Littlefinger said. \\n\"You will. You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion\\'s purse, surely you can scrape \\nPage 181\\n\\ntogether a few coppers to keep the king\\'s peace.\" Ned turned back to Janos Slynt. \"I will also give you \\ntwenty good swords from my own household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.\" \\n\"All thanks, Lord Hand,\" Slynt said, bowing. \"I promise you, they shall be put to good use.\" \\nWhen the Commander had taken his leave, Eddard Stark turned to the rest of the council. \"The sooner \\nthis folly is done with, the better I shall like it.\" As if the expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all \\nand sundry insisted on salting Ned\\'s wound by calling it \"the Hand\\'s tourney,\" as if he were the cause of \\nit. And Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored! \\n\"The realm prospers from such events, my lord,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"They bring the great the \\nchance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.\" \\n\"And put coins in many a pocket,\" Littlefinger added. \"Every inn in the city is full, and the whores are \\nwalking bowlegged and jingling with each step.\" \\nLord Renly laughed. \"We\\'re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us. Remember the time he \\nproposed to outlaw brothels? The king asked him if perhaps he\\'d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and \\nbreathing while he was at it. If truth be told, I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of \\nhis. He goes to his marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a \\ndetermination to do his duty.\" \\nNed had not joined the laughter. \"I wonder about your brother Stannis as well. I wonder when he \\nintends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on this council.\" \\n\"No doubt as soon as we\\'ve scourged all those whores into the sea,\" Littlefinger replied, provoking more \\nlaughter. \\n\"I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,\" Ned said, rising. \"Until the morrow.\" \\nHarwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand. \\n\"Summon Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,\" Ned told him, too brusquely. \\n\"As you say, my lord.\" \\nThe Red Keep and the \"Hand\\'s tourney\" were chafing him raw, Ned reflected as he climbed. He \\nyearned for the comfort of Catelyn\\'s arms, for the sounds of Robb and Jon crossing swords in the \\npractice yard, for the cool days and cold nights of the north. \\nIn his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the book while he waited for \\nJory to arrive. The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With \\nDescliptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, by Grand Maester Malleon. \\nPycelle had spoken truly; it made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt \\ncertain he had reasons. There was something here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow pages, if only \\nhe could see it. But what? The tome was over a century old. Scarcely a man now alive had yet been born \\nwhen Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of weddings, births, and deaths. \\nHe opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages slowly, hoping against \\nPage 182\\n\\nhope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters were an old family, tracing their descent back \\nto Lann the Clever, a trickster from the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the \\nBuilder, though far more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who \\nwinkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole gold from the sun to \\nbrighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to winkle the truth out of this damnable book. \\nA sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon\\'s tome and bid him enter. \"I\\'ve \\npromised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney is done,\" he told him. \"I rely on you to \\nmake the choice. Give Alyn the command, and make certain the men understand that they are needed to \\nstop fights, not start them.\" Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. \"Did \\nyou find the stableboy?\" \\n\"The watchman, my lord,\" Jory said. \"He vows he\\'ll never touch another horse.\" \\n\"What did he have to say?\" \\n\"He claims he knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, they were.\" Jory snorted. \"The Hand always gave the \\nlads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way with horses. Never rode his mounts too hard, and \\nbrought them carrots and apples, so they were always pleased to see him.\" \\n\"Carrots and apples,\" Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would \\nbe even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had \\nspoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a \\nnew-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he \\nwould not be questioned by a mere captain of guards . . . even if said captain was ten years older and a \\nhundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said Lord Jon had been \\nreading more than was good for him, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son\\'s frailty, \\nand gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with \\nLord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the \\nlord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, the lord had \\ntaken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, the lord had visited a master armorer to \\ncommission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl \\nmoon on the breast. The king\\'s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy \\nsaid. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis. \\n\"Did our watchman recall anything else of note?\" \\n\"The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often went riding with Lord Stannis, he \\nsays.\" \\nStannis again, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never \\nfriendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to \\nDragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his brother\\'s name. He had given no \\nword as to when he might return. \"Where did they go on these rides?\" Ned asked. \\n\"The boy says that they visited a brothel.\" \\n\"A brothel?\" Ned said. \"The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a brothel with Stannis \\nPage 183\\n\\nBaratheon?\" He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. \\nRobert\\'s lusts were the subject of ribald drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different \\nsort of man; a bare year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, grim \\nin his sense of duty. \\n\"The boy insists it\\'s true. The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the boy says they were joking of \\nit when he took their horses afterward.\" \\n\"Which brothel?\" Ned asked. \\n\"The boy did not know. The guards would.\" \\n\"A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,\" Ned said dryly. \"The \\ngods are doing their best to vex us. Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis ... everyone who might \\nactually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.\" \\n\"Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?\" \\n\"Not yet,\" Ned said. \"Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about and where he stands.\" The \\nmatter nagged at him. Why did Stannis leave? Had he played some part in Jon Arryn\\'s murder? Or was \\nhe afraid? Ned found it hard to imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held \\nStorm\\'s End through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell and \\nRedwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls. \\n\"Bring me my doublet, if you would. The grey, with the direwolf sigil. I want this armorer to know who I \\nam. It might make him more forthcoming.\" \\nJory went to the wardrobe. \"Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as the king.\" \\n\"Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.\" Ned was not sure what to make of Renly, with all \\nhis friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite \\nrose gold locklet. Inside was a miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with doe\\'s \\neyes and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl reminded him of \\nanyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed disappointed. The maid was Loras \\nTyrell\\'s sister Margaery, he\\'d confessed, but there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. \"No,\" \\nNed had told him, bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had \\nconceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as more than passing \\nqueer. \\nJory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. \"Perhaps Lord Stannis will \\nreturn for Robert\\'s tourney,\" he said as Jory laced the garment up the back. \\n\"That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,\" Jory said. \\nNed buckled on a longsword. \"In other words, not bloody likely.\" His smile was grim. \\nJory draped Ned\\'s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with the Hand\\'s badge of \\noffice. \"The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at the top of the Street of Steel. Alyn knows \\nPage 184\\n\\nthe way, my lord.\" \\nNed nodded. \"The gods help this potboy if he\\'s sent me off haring after shadows.\" It was a slim enough \\nstaff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered \\nplate. Steel was steel; it was meant for protection, not ornament. He \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 245 \\nmight have changed his views, to be sure. He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look \\non things differently after a few years at court . . . but the change was marked enough to make Ned \\nwonder. \\n\"Is there any other service I might perform?\" \\n\"I suppose you\\'d best begin visiting whorehouses.\" \\n\"Hard duty, my lord.\" Jory grinned. \"The men will be glad to help. Porther has made a fair start already.\" \\nNed\\'s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard. Varly and Jacks fell in beside him as he rode \\nthrough the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must have been sweltering, yet they said no word of \\ncomplaint. As Lord Eddard passed beneath the King\\'s Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white \\ncloak streaming from his shoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a trot. His guard \\nfollowed. \\nHe looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded city streets. Tomard and \\nDesmond had left the castle early this morning to take up positions on the route they must take, and \\nwatch for anyone following them, but even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King\\'s Spider and \\nhis little birds had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night. \\nThe Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as it was named on maps, or the \\nMud Gate, as it was commonly called. A mummer on stilts was striding through the throngs like some \\ngreat insect, with a horde of barefoot children trailing behind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys \\nno older than Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious curses of \\nothers. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and emptying a bucket of slops \\non the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing \\nout, \"Apples, the best apples, cheap at twice the price,\" and \"Blood melons, sweet as honey,\" and \\n\"Turnips, onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go here.\" \\nThe Mud Gate was open, and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the portcullis in their golden \\ncloaks, leaning on spears. When a column of riders appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into \\naction, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his \\nescort. The first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind like a \\nliving thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple lightning. \"Make way for Lord \\nBeric!\" the rider shouted. \"Make wayfor Lord Befic!\" And close behind came the young lord himself, a \\ndashing \\nI \\nfigure on a black courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars. \"Here to fight in \\nPage 185\\n\\nthe Hand\\'s tourney, my lord?\" a guardsman called out to him. \"Here to win the Hand\\'s tourney,\" Lord \\nBeric shouted back as the crowd cheered. \\nNed turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and \\nfollowed its winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders haggling over \\nmail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors from their wagons. The farther they \\nclimbed, the larger the buildings grew. The man they wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a \\nhuge house of timber and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors \\nshowed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood. A pair of stone knights stood sentry at the \\nentrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that transformed them into griffin and unicorn. \\nNed left his horse with Jacks and shouldered his way inside. \\nThe slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned\\'s badge and the sigil on his doublet, and the master \\ncame hurrying out, all smiles and bows. \"Wine for the King\\'s Hand,\" he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a \\ncouch. \"I am Tobho Mott, my lord, please, please, put yourself at ease.\" He wore a black velvet coat \\nwith hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread, Around his neck was a heavy silver chain and \\na sapphire as large as a pigeon\\'s egg. \"If you are in need of new arms for the Hand\\'s tourney, you have \\ncome to the right shop.\" Ned did not bother to correct him. \"My work is costly, and I make no apologies \\nfor \\nthat, my lord,\" he said as he filled two matching silver goblets. \"You will not find craftsmanship equal to \\nmine anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms, I promise you. Visit every forge in King\\'s Landing if you like, and \\ncompare for yourself. Any village smith can hammer out a shift of mail; my work is art.\" \\nNed sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all his armor here, Tobho \\nboasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king\\'s own \\nbrother. Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly\\'s new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers? \\nNo other armorer in the city could \\nget that deep a green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint and enamel were the \\ncrutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian \\nsteel at the forges of Oohor as a boy. Only a man who knew \\nthe spells could take old weapons and forge them anew. \"The direwolf was the sigil of House Stark, is it \\nnot? I could fashion a direwolf helm so real that children will run from you in the street,\" he vowed. \\nNed smiled. \"Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?\" \\nTobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. \"The Hand did call upon me, with Lord \\nStannis, the king\\'s brother. I regret to say, they did not honor me with their patronage.\" \\nNed looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found over the years that silence \\nsometimes yielded more than questions. And so it was this time. \\n\"They asked to see the boy,\" the armorer said, \"so I took them back to the forge.\" \\n\"The boy,\" Ned echoed. He had no notion who the boy might be. \"I should like to see the boy as well.\" \\nPage 186\\n\\nTobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. \"As you wish, my lord,\" he said with no trace of his former \\nfriendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn \\nwhere the work was done. When the armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through \\nmade Ned feel as though he were walking into a dragon\\'s mouth. Inside, a forge blazed in each corner, \\nand the air stank of smoke and sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up from their hammers and tongs \\njust long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the \\nbellows. \\nThe master called over a tall lad about Robb\\'s age, his arms and chest corded with muscle. \"This is Lord \\nStark, the new Hand of the King,\" he told him as the boy looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and \\npushed back sweat-soaked hair with his fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink. The \\nshadow of a new beard darkened his jaw. \"This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. Show \\nthe Hand that helmet you made, lad.\" Almost shyly, the boy led them to his bench, and a steel helm \\nshaped like a bull\\'s head, with two great curving horns. \\nNed turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but expertly shaped. \"This is fine \\nwork. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.\" \\nThe boy snatched it out of his hands. \"It\\'s not for sale.\" \\nTobho Mott looked horror-struck. \"Boy, this is the King\\'s Hand. If his lordship wants this helm, make \\nhim a gift of it. He honors you by asking.\" \\n\"I made it for me,\" the boy said stubbornly. \\n\"A hundred pardons, my lord,\" his master said hurriedly to Ned. \"The boy is crude as new steel, and like \\nnew steel would profit from some beating. That helm is journeyman\\'s work at best. Forgive him and I \\npromise I will craft you a helm like none you have ever seen.\" \\n\"He\\'s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn came to see you, what did \\nyou talk about?\" \\n\"He asked me questions is all, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"What sort of questions?\" \\nThe boy shrugged. \"How was 1, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, and stuff about my \\nmother. Who she was and what she looked like and all.\" \\n\"What did you tell him?\" Ned asked. \\nThe boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead. \"She died when I was little. She had yellow \\nhair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. She worked in an alehouse.\" \\n\"Did Lord Stannis question you as well?\" \\n\"The bald one? No, not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I was some raper who done \\nfor his daughter.\" \\nPage 187\\n\\n\"Mind your filthy tongue,\" the master said. \"This is the King\\'s own Hand.\" The boy lowered his eyes. \"A \\nsmart boy, but stubborn. That helm . . . the others call him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.\" \\nNed touched the boy\\'s head, fingering the thick black hair. \"Look at me, Gendry.\" The apprentice lifted \\nhis face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he thought, I see it. \"Go back to \\nyour work, lad. I\\'m sorry to have bothered you.\" He walked back to the house with the master. \"Who \\npaid the boy\\'s apprentice fee?\" he asked lightly. \\nMott looked fretful. \"You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those hands were made \\nfor hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.\" \\n\"The truth now,\" Ned urged. \"The streets are full of strong boys. The day you take on an apprentice \\nwithout a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?\" \\n\"A lord,\" the master said reluctantly. \"He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat. He paid in gold, \\ntwice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.\" \\n\"Describe him.\" \\n\"He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I\\'ll \\nswear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the \\nhood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear.\" He hesitated a moment. \"My lord, I want no \\ntrouble.\" \\n\"None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,\" Ned said. \"You know who \\nthe boy is.\" \\n\"I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I\\'m told.\" \\n\"You know who the boy is,\" Ned repeated patiently. \"That is not a question.\" \\n\"The boy is my apprentice,\" the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, stubborn as old iron. \"Who he \\nwas before he came to me, that\\'s none of my concern.\" \\nNed nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. \"If the day ever comes when \\nGendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to me. He has the look of a warrior. Until \\nthen, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and my promise. Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, \\nthis will be the first place I visit.\" \\nHis guard was waiting outside with the horses. \"Did you find anything, my lord?\" Jacks asked as Ned \\nmounted up. \\n\"I did,\" Ned told him, wondering. What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king\\'s bastard, and why was it \\nworth his life? \\nCATELYN \\nPage 188\\n\\nMy lady, you ought cover your head,\" Ser Rodrik told her as their horses plodded north. \"You will take \\na chill.\" \\n\"It is only water, Ser Rodrik,\" Catelyn replied. Her hair hung wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her \\nforehead, and she could imagine how ragged and wild she must look, but for once she did not care. The \\nsouthern rain was soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother\\'s kisses. It \\ntook her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the godswood, drooping \\nbranches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother\\'s laughter as he chased her through piles of \\ndamp leaves. She remembered making mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown \\nbetween her fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he\\'d eaten so much mud he was \\nsick for a week. How young they all had been. \\nCatelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and sometimes at night it turned to \\nice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That \\nwas no rain for little girls to play in. \\n\"I am soaked through,\" Ser Rodrik complained. \"Even my bones are wet.\" The woods pressed close \\naround them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves was accompanied by the small sucking sounds \\ntheir horses made as their hooves pulled free of the mud. \"We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot \\nmeal would serve us both.\" \\n\"There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,\" Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her \\nyouth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding \\nsomewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf \\nnight and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The \\nsweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded \\nthose smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha\\'s teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror. \\n\"An inn,\" Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. \"If only . . . but we dare not risk it. If we wish to remain \\nunknown, I think it best we seek out some small holdfast . . .\" He broke off as they heard sounds up the \\nroad; splashing water, the clink of mail, a horse\\'s whinny. \"Riders,\" he warned, his hand dropping to the \\nhilt of his sword. Even on the kingsroad, it never hurt to be wary. \\nThey followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a column of armed men noisily \\nfording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider \\nhung sodden and limp, but the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle \\nof Seagard. \"Mallisters,\" Ser Rodrik whispered to her, as if she had not known. \"My lady, best pull up \\nyour hood.\" \\nCatelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, surrounded by his knights, his son \\nPatrek by his side and their squires close behind. They were riding for King\\'s Landing and the Hand\\'s \\ntourney, she knew. For the past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights \\nand freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or corn or casks of \\nhoney, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving south. \\nShe studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been jesting with her uncle at her \\nwedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair \\nPage 189\\n\\nwas salted with white now, his face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He \\nrode like a man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. As the \\nriders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high lord\\'s courtesy to strangers \\nchance met on the road. There was no recognition in those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a \\nlook. \\n\"He did not know you,\" Ser Rodrik said after, wondering. \\n\"He saw a pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and tired. It would never occur to \\nhim to suspect that one of them was the daughter of his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the \\ninn, Ser Rodrik.\" \\nIt was near dark when they reached it, at the crossroads north of the great confluence of the Trident. \\nMasha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave \\nthem only the most cursory of looks, with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. \"Two rooms at the top of \\nthe stair, that\\'s all there is,\" she said, chewing all the while. \"They\\'re under the bell tower, you won\\'t be \\nmissing meals, though there\\'s some thinks it too noisy. Can\\'t be helped. We\\'re full up, or near as makes \\nno matter. It\\'s those rooms or the road.\" \\nIt was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow staircase. \"Leave your boots \\ndown here,\" Masha told them after she\\'d taken their coin. \"The boy will clean them. I won\\'t have you \\ntracking mud up my stairs. Mind the bell. Those who come late to meals don\\'t eat.\" There were no \\nsmiles, and no mention of sweet cakes. \\nWhen the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed into dry clothes. She sat by \\nthe window, watching rain run down the pane. The glass was milky and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk \\nwas falling outside. Catelyn could just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met. \\nThe crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy ride down to Riverrun. \\nHer father had always given her wise counsel when she needed it most, and she yearned to talk to him, to \\nwarn him of the gathering storm. If Winterfell needed to brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so \\nmuch closer to King\\'s Landing, with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a shadow. If \\nonly her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster Tully had been bedridden these \\npast two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him now. \\nThe eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky foothills and thick forests into \\nthe Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony \\nFingers beyond. Above the Vale, the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. \\nThere she would find her sister . . . and, perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa knew \\nmore than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof that Ned needed to bring the \\nLannisters to ruin, and if it came to \\nwar, they would need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service. \\nYet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock slides were common, and \\nthe mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending from the heights to rob and kill and melting away \\nlike snow whenever the knights rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord \\nPage 190\\n\\nas any the Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when he crossed the mountains. \\nCatelyn\\'s only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty. \\nNo, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran north to Winterfell, where her \\nsons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as they were safely past the Neck, she could declare \\nherself to one of Ned\\'s bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the \\nkingsroad. \\nThe rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land clear enough in her \\nmemory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the village a mile farther on, half a hundred white \\ncottages surrounding a small stone sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and \\npeaceful. North of here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys and \\ngreen woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the river lords. \\nCatelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, whose quarrels her father was \\nobliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of \\nHarrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children, \\ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All of them were \\nbannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would \\nbe enough, if it came to war. Her father was the staunchest man who\\'d ever lived, and she had no doubt \\nthat he would call his banners . . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons \\nhad sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident, while \\nLord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving some doubt as to which army \\nhe had planned to join (theirs, he had assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her \\nfather had called him the Late Lord Frey). It must not come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They must \\nnot let it. \\nSer Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. \"We had best make haste if we hope to eat \\ntonight, my lady.\" \\n\"It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the \\nNeck,\" she told him. \"Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the road on \\nsome family business, say.\" \\n\"As you say, my lady,\" Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that he realized what he\\'d \\ndone. \"The old courtesies die hard, my-my daughter.\" He tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed \\nwith exasperation. \\nCatelyn took his arm. \"Come, Father,\" she said. \"You\\'ll find that Masha Heddle sets a good table, I \\nthink, but try not to praise her. You truly don\\'t want to see her smile.\" \\nThe common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at one end and a fireplace at \\nthe other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, \\nchewing her sourleaf all the while. \\nThe benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all manner of travelers. The \\ncrossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen \\nreeking of fish, an ironsmith thick with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten \\nPage 191\\n\\nsellswords and soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions. \\nThe company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by the fire wore the red \\nstallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery \\ngrey. On their shoulder was another familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, \\nbut they were all too young to have known her. The senior among them would have been no older than \\nBran when she went north. \\nSer Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across the table a handsome \\nyouth was fingering a woodharp. \"Seven blessings to you, goodfolk,\" he said as they sat. An empty wine \\ncup stood on the table before him. \\n\"And to you, singer,\" Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat and beer in a tone that \\nmeant now. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed them boldly and asked where they were \\ngoing, and from whence they had come, and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as \\narrows and never pausing for an answer. \"We left King\\'s Landing a fortnight ago,\" Catelyn replied, \\nanswering the safest of his questions. \\n\"That\\'s where I\\'m bound,\" the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more interested in telling his \\nown story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half so well as the sound of their own voices. \"The \\nHand\\'s tourney means rich lords with fat purses. The last time I \\ncame away with more silver than I could carry ... or would have, if I hadn\\'t lost it all betting on the \\nKingslayer to win the day.\" \\n\"The gods frown on the gambler,\" Ser Rodrik said sternly. He was of the north, and shared the Stark \\nviews on tournaments. \\n\"They frowned on me, for certain,\" the singer said. \"Your cruel gods and the Knight of Flowers \\naltogether did me in.\" \\n\"No doubt that was a lesson for you,\" Ser Rodrik said. \\n\"It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.\" \\nSer Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could frame a rebuke the serving \\nboy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before them and filled them with chunks of browned \\nmeat off a skewer, dripping with hot juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat \\nmushrooms. Ser Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer. \\n\"My name is Marillion,\" the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. \"Doubtless you\\'ve heard me \\nplay somewhere?\" \\nHis manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far north as Winterfell, but she \\nknew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. \"I fear not,\" she told him. \\nHe drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. \"That is your loss,\" he said. \"Who was the finest singer \\nyou\\'ve ever heard?\" \\nPage 192\\n\\n\"Alia of Braavos,\" Ser Rodrik answered at once. \\n\"Oh, I\\'m much better than that old stick,\" Marillion said. \"If you have the silver for a song, I\\'ll gladly \\nshow you.\" \\n\"I might have a copper or two, but I\\'d sooner toss it down a well than pay for your howling,\" Ser Rodrik \\ngroused. His opinion of singers was well known; music was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not \\ncomprehend why any healthy boy would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword. \\n\"Your grandfather has a sour nature,\" Marillion said to Catelyn. \"I meant to do you honor. An homage to \\nyour beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and high lords.\" \\n\"Oh, I can see that,\" Catelyn said. \"Lord Tully is fond of song, I hear. No doubt you\\'ve been to \\nRiverrun.\" \\n\"A hundred times,\" the singer said airily. \"They keep a chamber for me, and the young lord is like a \\nbrother.\" \\nCatelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer had once bedded a girl her \\nbrother fancied; he had hated the breed ever since. \"And Winterfell?\" she asked him. \"Have you traveled \\nnorth?\" \\n\"Why would IT\\' Marillion asked. \"It\\'s all blizzards and bearskins up there, and the Starks know no music \\nbut the howling of wolves.\" \\nDistantly, she was aware of the door banging open at the far end of the room. \\n\"Innkeep,\" a servant\\'s voice called out behind her, \"we have horses that want stabling, and my lord of \\nLannister requires a room and a hot bath.\" \\n\"Oh, gods,\" Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her fingers tightening hard \\naround his forearm. \\nMasha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. \"I\\'m sorry, m\\'lord, truly, we\\'re full up, \\nevery room.\" \\nThere were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night\\'s Watch, two servants . . . \\nand him, standing there small and bold as life. \"My men will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I \\ndo not require a large room, as you can plainly see.\" He flashed a mocking grin. \"So long as the fire\\'s \\nwarm and the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man.\" \\nMasha Heddle was beside herself. \"M\\'lord, there\\'s nothing, it\\'s the tourney, there\\'s no help for it, oh . . .\" \\nTyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head, caught it, tossed it again. \\nEven across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold was unmistakable. \\nA freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet. \"You\\'re welcome to my room, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"Now there\\'s a clever man,\" Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across the room. The freerider \\nPage 193\\n\\nsnatched it from the air. \"And a nimble one to boot.\" The dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle. \"You will \\nbe able to manage food, I trust?\" \\n\"Anything you like, m1ord, anything at all,\" the innkeep promised. And may he choke on it, Catelyn \\nthought, but it was Bran she saw choking, drowning on his own blood. \\nLannister glanced at the nearest tables. \"My men will have whatever you\\'re serving these people. Double \\nportions, we\\'ve had a long hard ride. I\\'ll take a roast fowl-chicken, duck, pigeon, it makes no matter. \\nAnd send up a flagon of your best wine. Yoren, will you sup with me?\" \\n\"Aye, m1ord, I will,\" the black brother replied. \\nThe dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and Catelyn was thinking how \\ngrateful she was for the crowded benches between them when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet. \\n\"My lord of Lannister!\" he called out. \"I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you \\nthe lay of your father\\'s great victory at King\\'s Landing!\" \\n\"Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,\" the dwarf said \\ndryly. His mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away . . . and found Catelyn. \\nHe looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too late. The dwarf was smiling. \\n\"Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,\" he said. \"I was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.\" \\nMarillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose slowly to her feet. She heaTd \\nSeT Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the Wall, she thought, if only . . . \\n\"Lady . . . Stark?\" Masha Heddle said thickly. \\n\"I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,\" she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, \\nfeel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, \\nand took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no \\ntime to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. \"You in the \\ncorner,\" she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. \"Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see \\nembroidered on your surcoat, ser?\" \\nThe man got to his feet. \"It is, my lady.\" \\n\"And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?\" \\n\"She is,\" the man replied stoutly. \\nSer Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was blinking at them, \\nblank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes. \\n\"The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,\" she said to the trio by the fire. \"My father counts \\nJonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal bannermen.\" \\nThe three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. \"Our lord is honored by his trust,\" one of them said \\nhesitantly. \\nPage 194\\n\\n\"I envy your father all these fine friends,\" Lannister quipped, \"but I do not quite see the purpose of this, \\nLady Stark.\" \\nShe ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the heart of the matter; there \\nwere more than twenty of them. \"I know your sigil as well: the twin towers of Frey. How fares your good \\nlord, sers?\" \\nTheir captain rose. \"Lord Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new wife on his ninetieth name \\nday, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding with his presence.\" \\nTyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. \"This man came a guest into my \\nhouse, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of seven,\" she proclaimed to the room at large, \\nI \\npointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, his sword in hand. \"In the name of King Robert and the good \\nlords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king\\'s \\njustice.\" \\nShe did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords drawn as one or the look on \\nTyrion Lannister\\'s face. \\nSANSA \\nSansa rode to the Hand\\'s tourney with Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, in a litter with curtains of \\nyellow silk so fine she could see right through them. They turned the whole world gold. Beyond the city \\nwalls, a hundred pavilions had been raised beside the river, and the common folk came out in the \\nthousands to watch the games. The splendor of it all took Sansa\\'s breath away; the shining armor, the \\ngreat chargers caparisoned in silver and gold, the shouts of the crowd, the banners snapping in the wind . \\n. . and the knights themselves, the knights most of all. \\n\"It is better than the songs,\" she whispered when they found the places that her father had promised her, \\namong the high lords and ladies. Sansa was dressed beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out \\nthe auburn of her hair, and she knew they were looking at her and smiling. \\nThey watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous than the last. The seven \\nknights of the Kingsguard took the field, all but Jaime Lannister in scaled armor the color of milk, their \\ncloaks as white as freshfallen snow. Ser Jaime wore the white cloak as well, but beneath it he was shining \\ngold from head to foot, with a lion\\'shead helm and a golden sword. Ser Gregor Clegane, the Mountain \\nThat Rides, thundered past them like an avalanche. Sansa remembered Lord Yohn Royce, who had \\nguested at Winterfell two years \\n260 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN \\nbefore. \"His armor is bronze, thousands and thousands of years old, engraved with magic runes that \\nward him against harm,\" she whispered to Jeyne. Septa Mordane pointed out Lord Jason Mallister, in \\nPage 195\\n\\nindigo chased with silver, the wings of an eagle on his helm. He had cut down three of Rhaegar\\'s \\nbannermen on the Trident. The girls giggled over the warrior priest Thoros of Myr, with his flapping red \\nrobes and shaven head, until the septa told them that he had once scaled the walls of Pyke with a flaming \\nsword in hand. \\nOther riders Sansa did not know; hedge knights from the Fingers and Highgarden and the mountains of \\nDorne, unsung freeriders and new-made squires, the younger sons of high lords and the heirs of lesser \\nhouses. Younger men, most had done no great deeds as yet, but Sansa and Jeyne agreed that one day \\nthe Seven Kingdoms would resound to the sound of their names. Ser Balon Swann. Lord Bryce Caron \\nof the Marches. Bronze Yohn\\'s heir, Ser Andar Royce, and his younger brother Ser Robar, their silvered \\nsteel plate filigreed in bronze with the same ancient runes that warded their father. The twins Ser Horas \\nand Ser Hobber, whose shields displayed the grape cluster sigil of the Redwynes, burgundy on blue. \\nPatrek Mallister, Lord Jason\\'s son. Six Freys of the Crossing: Ser Jared, Ser Hosteen, Ser Danwell, Ser \\nEmmon, Ser Theo, Ser Perwyn, sons and grandsons of old Lord Walder Frey, and his bastard son \\nMartyn Rivers as well. \\nJeyne Poole confessed herself frightened by the look of Jalabhar Xho, an exile prince from the Summer \\nIsles who wore a cape of green and scarlet feathers over skin as dark as night, but when she saw young \\nLord Beric Dondarrion, with his hair like red gold and his black shield slashed by lightning, she \\npronounced herself willing to marry him on the instant. \\nThe Hound entered the lists as well, and so too the king\\'s brother, handsome Lord Renly of Storm\\'s \\nEnd. Jory, Alyn, and Harwin rode for Winterfell and the north. \"Jory looks a beggar among these others,\" \\nSepta Mordane sniffed when he appeared. Sansa could only agree. Jory\\'s armor was blue-grey plate \\nwithout device or ornament, and a thin grey cloak hung from his shoulders like a soiled rag. Yet he \\nacquitted himself well, unhorsing Horas Redwyne in his first joust and one of the Freys in his second. In \\nhis third match, he rode three passes at a freerider named Lothor Brune whose armor was as drab as his \\nown. Neither man lost his seat, but Brune\\'s lance was steadier and his blows better placed, and the king \\ngave him the victory. Alyn and Harwin fared less well; Harwin was unhorsed in his first tilt by Ser Meryn \\nof the Kingsguard, while Alyn fell to Ser Balon Swann. \\nThe jousting went all day and into the dusk, the hooves of the great \\nwarhorses pounding down the lists until the field was a ragged wasteland of torn earth. A dozen times \\nJeyne and Sansa cried out in unison as riders crashed together, lances exploding into splinters while the \\ncommons screamed for their favorites. Jeyne covered her eyes whenever a man fell, like a frightened little \\ngirl, but Sansa was made of sterner stuff. A great lady knew how to behave at tournaments. Even Septa \\nMordane noted her composure and nodded in approval. \\nThe Kingslayer rode brilliantly. He overthrew Ser Andar Royce and the Marcher Lord Bryce Caron as \\neasily as if he were riding at rings, and then took a hard-fought match from white-haired Barristan Selmy, \\nwho had won his first two tilts against men thirty and forty years his junior. \\nSandor Clegane and his immense brother, Ser Gregor the Mountain, seemed unstoppable as well, riding \\ndown one foe after the next in ferocious style. The most terrifying moment of the day came during Ser \\nGregor\\'s second joust, when his lance rode up and struck a young knight from the Vale under the gorget \\nwith such force that it drove through his throat, killing him instantly. The youth fell not ten feet from where \\nSansa was seated. The point of Ser Gregor\\'s lance had snapped off in his neck, and his life\\'s blood \\nflowed out in slow pulses, each weaker than the one before. His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of \\nPage 196\\n\\nfire ran down his outstretched arm, as the steel caught the light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it \\nwas gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summer\\'s day, trimmed with a border of \\ncrescent moons, but as his blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened and the moons turned red, one by \\none. \\nJeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to regain her composure, but \\nSansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with a strange fascination. She had never seen a man \\ndie before. She ought to be crying too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used \\nup all her tears for Lady and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, she \\ntold herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some stranger from the Vale of Arryn \\nwhose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard it. And now the world would forget his name too, \\nSansa realized; there would be no songs sung for him. That was sad. \\nAfter they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and shoveled dirt over the spot \\nwhere he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the jousts resumed. \\nSer Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was unhorsed so violently \\nthat he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. His head hit the ground with an audible \\ncrack \\nthat made the crowd gasp, but it was just the golden antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off \\nbeneath him. When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King Robert\\'s \\nhandsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine to his conqueror with a \\ngracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken antler into the crowd, where the commons \\nbegan to punch and claw over the little bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored \\nthe peace. By then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; she had \\nhelped her back to the castle. Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne. \\nLater a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric Dondarrion\\'s horse, and \\nwas declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new mount, only to be knocked right off it by \\nThoros of Myr. Ser Aron Santagar and Lothor Brune tilted thrice without result; Ser Aron fell afterward \\nto Lord Jason Mallister, and Brune to Yohn Royce\\'s younger son, Robar. \\nIn the end it came down to four; the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor, Jaime Lannister the \\nKingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the Knight of Flowers. \\nSer Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and Warden of the South. At \\nsixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that \\nmorning in his first three jousts. Sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful. His plate was intricately \\nfashioned and enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion was \\ndraped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would remove his helm and \\nride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair \\nmaiden in the crowd. \\nHis last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar\\'s ancestral runes proved small \\nprotection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in \\nthe dirt. Robar lay moaning as the victor made his circuit of the field. Finally they called for a litter and \\ncarried him off to his tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser Loras. \\nWhen the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would burst. \\nPage 197\\n\\nTo the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her was red. \"Sweet lady,\" he \\nsaid, \"no victory is half so beautiful as you.\" Sansa took the flower timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. \\nHis hair was a mass of lazy brown curls, his eyes like liquid \\ngold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off. \\nWhen Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was short, with a pointed beard \\nand a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. \"You must be one of her daughters,\" he said to \\nher. He had grey-green eyes that did not smile when his mouth did. \"You have the Tully look.\" \\n\"I\\'m Sansa Stark,\" she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur collar, fastened with a \\nsilver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a high lord, but she did not know him. \"I have not \\nhad the honor, my lord.\" \\nSepta Mordane quickly took a hand. \"Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, of the king\\'s small \\ncouncil.\" \\n\"Your mother was my queen of beauty once,\" the man said quietly. His breath smelled of mint. \"You \\nhave her hair.\" His fingers brushed against her cheek as he stroked one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he \\nturned and walked away. \\nBy then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed that the last three matches \\nwould be fought the next morning, before the melee. While the commons began their walk home, talking \\nof the day\\'s jousts and the matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the \\nfeast. Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden spits while \\nkitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled and spit. Tables and benches had \\nbeen raised outside the pavilions, piled high with sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-baked bread. \\nSansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the raised dais where the king \\nhimself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated himself to her right, she felt her throat tighten. \\nHe had not spoken a word to her since the awful thing had happened, and she had not dared to speak to \\nhim. At first she thought she hated him for what they\\'d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept her eyes \\ndry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey\\'s doing, not truly. The queen had done it; she was the one \\nto hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have happened except for Arya. \\nShe could not hate Joffrey tonight. He was too beautiful to hate. He wore a deep blue doublet studded \\nwith a double row of golden lion\\'s heads, and around his brow a slim coronet made of gold and \\nsapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. Sansa looked at him and trembled, afraid that he might \\nignore her or, worse, turn hateful again and send her weeping from the table. \\nInstead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant \\nas any prince in the songs, and said, \"Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.\" \\n\"He was too kind,\" she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though her heart was singing. \"Ser \\nLoras is a true knight. Do you think he will win tomorrow, my lord?\" \\nPage 198\\n\\n\"No,\" Jofftey said. \"My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And in a few years, when I am \\nold enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.\" He raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon \\nof iced surnmerwine, and poured her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Jofftey leaned \\nover and filled the septa\\'s cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said not another \\nword. \\nThe servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall ever tasting the wine. She \\nneeded no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties \\nshe had dreamt of all her life and never dared hope to know. Singers sat before the king\\'s pavilion, filling \\nthe dusk with music. A juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The king\\'s own \\nfool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, all in motley, making mock of \\neveryone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered if he was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was \\nhelpless before him; when he sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled \\nwine on herself. \\nAnd Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering her with compliments, \\nmaking her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, explaining Moon Boy\\'s japes. Sansa was so \\ncaptivated that she quite forgot all her courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left. \\nAll the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. Salads of sweetgrass and \\nspinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in honey and garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails \\nbefore; Jofftey showed her how to get the snail out of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself. \\nThen came trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard casing to \\nexpose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was brought out, he served her himself, \\nslicing a queen\\'s portion from the joint, smiling as he laid it on her plate. She could see from the way he \\nmoved that his right arm was still troubling him, yet he uttered not a word of complaint. \\nLater came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with cinnamon and lemon cakes \\nfrosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that she could not manage more than two little lemon \\ncakes, as much as she loved them. She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king \\nbegan to shout. \\nKing Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa could hear him laughing or \\nroaring a command over the music and the clangor of plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for \\nher to make out his words. \\nNow everybody heard him. \"No, \" he thundered in a voice that drowned out all other speech. Sansa \\nwas shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he \\nwas drunk as a man could be. \"You do not tell me what to do, woman,\" he screamed at Queen Cersei. \"I \\nam king here, do you understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, I will fight!\" \\nEveryone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king\\'s brother Renly, and the short man who \\nhad talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one made a move to interfere. The queen\\'s face \\nwas a mask, so bloodless that it might have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered \\nher skirts around her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind. \\nJaime Lannister put a hand on the king\\'s shoulder, but the king shoved him away hard. Lannister \\nPage 199\\n\\nstumbled and fell. The king guffawed. \"The great knight. I can still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, \\nKingslayer.\" He slapped his chest with the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. \"Give \\nme my hammer and not a man in the realm can stand before me!\" \\nJaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off. \"As you say, Your Grace.\" His voice was stiff. \\nLord Renly came forward, smiling. \"You\\'ve spilled your wine, Robert. Let me bring you a fresh goblet.\" \\nSansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm. \"It grows late,\" the prince said. He had a queer look \\non his face, as if he were not seeing her at all. \"Do you need an escort back to the castle?\" \\n\"No,\" Sansa began. She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find her with her head on the \\ntable, snoring soft and ladylike snores. \"I mean to say . . . yes, thank you, that would be most kind. I am \\ntired, and the way is so dark. I should be glad for some protection.\" \\nJoffrey called out, \"Dog!\" \\nSandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he appear. He had exchanged his \\narmor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog\\'s head sewn on the front. The light of the torches made \\nhis burned face shine a dull red. \"Yes, Your Grace?\" he said. \\n\"Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls \\nher,\" the prince told him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, leaving her \\nthere. \\nSansa could feel the Hound watching her. \"Did you think Joff was going to take you himself?\" He \\nlaughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. \"Small chance of that.\" He pulled her unresisting \\nto her feet. \"Come, you\\'re not the only one needs sleep. I\\'ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my \\nbrother tomorrow.\" He laughed again. \\nSuddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane\\'s shoulder, hoping to wake her, but she only snored \\nthe louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the benches were suddenly empty. The feast was over, \\nand the beautiful dream had ended with it. \\nThe Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside him. The ground was \\nrocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift and move beneath her. She kept her eyes \\nlowered, watching where she placed her feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and \\nits armor hung outside, the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight of \\nhim, he frightened her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A true lady would not \\nnotice his face, she told herself. \"You rode gallantly today, Ser Sandor,\" she made herself say. \\nSandor Clegane snarled at her. \"Spare me your empty little compliments, girl . . . and your ser\\'s. I am no \\nknight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is a knight. Did you see him ride today?\" \\n\"Yes,\" Sansa whispered, trembling. \"He was \\n\"Gallant?\" the Hound finished. \\nPage 200\\n\\nHe was mocking her, she realized. \"No one could withstand him,\" she managed at last, proud of herself. \\nIt was no lie. \\nSandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She had no choice but to \\nstop beside him. \"Some septa trained you well. You\\'re like one of those birds from the Summer Isles, \\naren\\'t you? A pretty little talking -bird, repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.\" \\n\"That\\'s unkind.\" Sansa could feel her heart fluttering in her chest. \"You\\'re frightening me. I want to go \\nnow.\" \\n\"No one could withstand him, \" the Hound rasped. \"That\\'s truth enough. No one could ever withstand \\nGregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a pretty bit of business. You saw that, did you? \\nFool boy, he had no business riding in this company. No money, no squire, no one to help him with that \\narmor. That gorget wasn\\'t fastened proper. You think Gregor didn\\'t notice that? You think Ser Gregor\\'s \\nlance rode up by chance, do you? Pretty little talking girl, you \\nbelieve that, you\\'re empty-headed as a bird for true. Gregor\\'s lance goes where Gregor wants it to go. \\nLook at me. Look at me!\" Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and forced her face up. He \\nsquatted in front of her, and moved the torch close. \"There\\'s a pretty for you. Take a good long stare. \\nYou know you want to. I\\'ve watched you turning away all the way down the kingsroad. Piss on that. \\nTake your look.\" \\nHis fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. Drunken eyes, sullen with anger. \\nShe had to look. \\nThe right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye beneath a heavy brow. His \\nnose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair \\ngrew on the other side of that face. \\nThe left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was nothing left but a hole. His \\neye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked \\nwith craters and fissured by deep cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, \\nyou could see a hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away. \\nSansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. \"No pretty words for \\nthat, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?\" When there was no answer, he continued. \"Most of \\nthem, they think it was some battle. A siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it \\nwas dragonsbreath.\" His laugh was softer this time, but just as bitter. \"I\\'ll tell you what it was, girl,\" he \\nsaid, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine \\non his breath. \"I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under \\nmy father\\'s keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don\\'t remember \\nwhat I got, but it was Gregor\\'s gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged \\nseparate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy \\nwas nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his \\nknight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. \\nThere was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and shoved \\nthe side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed. You \\nsaw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about \\nthe seven hells. What do they know? Only a man who\\'s been burned knows what hell is truly like. \\nPage 201\\n\\n268 \\nGEORGE R.R. MARTIN \\n\"My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave me ointments. Ointments! \\nGregor got his ointments too. Four years later, they anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his \\nknightly vows and Rhaegar Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, \\'Arise, Ser Gregor.\\' \" \\nThe rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black shape shrouded in the night, \\nhidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged breathing. She was sad for him, she realized. \\nSomehow, the fear had gone away. \\nThe silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, but she was afraid for him \\nnow, not for herself. She found his massive shoulder with her hand. \"He was no true knight,\" she \\nwhispered to him. \\nThe Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from him, but he caught her \\narm. \"No,\" he growled at her, \"no, little bird, he was no true knight.\" \\nThe rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her to where the carts were \\nwaiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, and climbed in after her. They rode in silence \\nthrough the King\\'s Gate and up torchlit city streets. He opened the postern door and led her into the \\ncastle, his burned face twitching and his eyes brooding, and he was one step behind her as they climbed \\nthe tower stairs. He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside her bedchamber. \\n\"Thank you, my lord,\" Sansa said meekly. \\nThe Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close. \"The things I told you tonight,\" he said, his voice \\nsounding even rougher than usual. \"If you ever tell Joffrey.... your sister, your father. . . any of them . . .\" \\n\"I won\\'t,\" Sansa whispered. \"I promise.\" \\nIt was not enough. \"If you ever tell anyone,\" he finished, \"I\\'ll kill you.\" \\nEDDARD \\n\"I stood last vigil for him myself,\" Ser Barristan Selmy said as they looked down at the body in the back \\nof the cart. \"He had no one else. A mother in the Vale, I am told.\" \\nIn the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. He had not been handsome, \\nbut death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet \\ntunic, with a high collar to cover the ruin the lance had made of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his \\nface, and wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister bannerman \\nbefore Ned could speak to him; could that be mere happenstance? He supposed he would never know. \\n\"Hugh was Jon Arryn\\'s squire for four years,\" Selmy went on. \"The king knighted him before he rode \\nnorth, in Jon\\'s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, yet I fear he was not ready.\" \\nPage 202\\n\\nNed had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. \"None of us is ever ready,\" he said. \\n\"For knighthood?\" \\n\"For death.\" Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of blue bordered in crescent \\nmoons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had \\nfought to honor the King\\'s Hand, Eddard Stark. \"This was needless. War should not be a game.\" Ned \\nturned to the woman beside \\nthe cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes. The silent sisters prepared men for the grave, \\nand it was ill fortune to look on the face of death. \"Send his armor home to the Vale. The mother will \\nwant to have it.\" \\n\"It is worth a fair piece of silver,\" Ser Barristan said. \"The boy had it forged special for the tourney. Plain \\nwork, but good. I do not know if he had finished paying the smith.\" \\n\"He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,\" Ned replied. And to the silent sister he said, \"Send the \\nmother the armor. I will deal with this smith.\" She bowed her head. \\nAfterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king\\'s pavilion. The camp was beginning to stir. Fat \\nsausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with the scents of garlic and pepper. Young squires \\nhurried about on errands as their masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man \\nwith a goose under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them. \"NI\\'lords,\" he muttered as the \\ngoose honked and pecked at his fingers. The shields displayed outside each tent heralded its occupant: \\nthe silver eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron\\'s field of nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, \\nbrindled boar, red ox, burning tree, white ram, triple spiral, purple unicorn, dancing maiden, blackadder, \\ntwin towers, horned owl, and last the pure white blazons of the Kingsguard, shining like the dawn. \\n\"The king means to fight in the melee today,\" Ser Barristan said as they were passing Ser Meryn\\'s shield, \\nits paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell\\'s lance had scarred the wood as he drove him from his \\nsaddle. \\n\"Yes,\" Ned said grimly. Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news. Small wonder he had slept \\nso badly. \\nSer Barristan\\'s look was troubled. \"They say night\\'s beauties fade at dawn, and the children of wine are \\noft disowned in the morning light.\" \\n\"They say so,\" Ned agreed, \"but not of Robert.\" Other men might reconsider words spoken in drunken \\nbravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, remembering, would never back down. \\nThe king\\'s pavilion was close by the water, and the morning mists off the river had wreathed it in wisps \\nof grey. It was all of golden silk, the largest and grandest structure in the camp. Outside the entrance, \\nRobert\\'s warhammer was displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of \\nHouse Baratheon. \\nNed had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck was not with him. They \\nfound Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and roaring his displeasure at two young squires who \\nwere trying to buckle him into his armor. \"Your Grace,\" one was \\nPage 203\\n\\nsaying, almost in tears, \"it\\'s made too small, it won\\'t go.\" He fumbled, and the gorget he was trying to fit \\naround Robert\\'s thick neck tumbled to the ground. \\n\"Seven hells!\" Robert swore. \"Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of you. Pick it up. Don\\'t just \\nstand there gaping, Lance], pick it up!\" The lad jumped, and the king noticed his company. \"Look at \\nthese oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take these two to squire for me, and they\\'re worse than useless. Can\\'t \\neven put a man\\'s armor on him properly. Squires, they say. I say they\\'re swineherds dressed up in silk.\" \\nNed only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. \"The boys are not at fault,\" he told the king. \\n\"You\\'re too fat for your armor, Robert.\" \\nRobert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his sleeping furs, wiped his \\nmouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, \"Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your king?\" \\nHe let go his laughter, sudden as a storm. \"Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?\" \\nThe squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. \"You. Yes, both of you. You heard the \\nHand. The king is too fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron Santagar. Tell him I need the breastplate \\nstretcher. Now! What are you waiting for?\" \\nThe boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent. Robert managed to keep a stern \\nface until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a chair, shaking with laughter. \\nSer Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. Always, though, the \\ngraver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the two squires: handsome boys, fair and well \\nmade. One was Sansa\\'s age, with long golden curls; the other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired, with a wisp \\nof a mustache and the emerald-green eyes of the queen. \\n\"Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar\\'s face,\" Robert said. \"I hope he\\'ll have the wit to send them \\nto someone else. We ought to keep them running all day!\" \\n\"Those boys,\" Ned asked him. \"Lannisters?\" \\nRobert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. \"Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin\\'s brother. One of the dead \\nones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on it. I don\\'t recall. My wife comes from a very \\nlarge family, Ned.\" \\nA very ambitious family, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but it troubled him to see \\nRobert surrounded by the queen\\'s kin, waking and sleeping. The Lannister appetite for offices and honors \\nseemed to know no bounds. \"The talk is you and the queen had angry words last night.\" \\nThe mirth curdled on Robert\\'s face. \"The woman tried to forbid me to fight in the melee. She\\'s sulking in \\nthe castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have shamed me like that.\" \\n\"You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,\" Ned told him. \"You saw her beauty, but not the iron \\nunderneath. She would have told you that you have no business in the melee.\" \\nPage 204\\n\\n\"You too?\" The king frowned. \"You are a sour man, Stark. Too long in the north, all the juices have \\nfrozen inside you. Well, mine are still running.\" He slapped his chest to prove it. \\n\"You are the king,\" Ned reminded him. \\n\"I sit on the damn iron seat when I must. Does that mean I don\\'t have the same hungers as other men? A \\nbit of wine now and again, a girl squealing in bed, the feel of a horse between my legs? Seven hells, Ned, \\nI want to hit someone.\" \\nSer Barristan Selmy spoke up. \"Your Grace,\" he said, \"it is not seemly that the king should ride into the \\nmelee. It would not be a fair contest. Who would dare strike you?\" \\nRobert seemed honestly taken aback. \"Why, all of them, damn it. If they can. And the last man left \\nstanding . . .\" \\n\". . . will be you,\" Ned finished. He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark. The dangers of the melee \\nwere only a savor to Robert, but this touched on his pride. \"Ser Barristan is right. There\\'s not a man in \\nthe Seven Kingdoms who would dare risk your displeasure by hurting \\nYOU.\" \\nThe king rose to his feet, his face flushed. \"Are you telling me those prancing cravens will let me win?\" \\n\"For a certainty,\" Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent accord. \\nFor a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the tent, whirled, strode back, \\nhis face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy \\nin a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. \"Get out,\" the king said then, coldly. \"Get out before I kill you.\" \\nSer Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out again. \"Not you, Ned.\" \\nNed turned back. Robert took up his horn again, filled it with beer from a barrel in the corner, and thrust \\nit at Ned. \"Drink,\" he said brusquely. \\n\"I\\'ve no thirst-\" \\n\"Diink. Your king commands it.\" \\nNed took the horn and drank. The beer was black and thick, so strong it stung the eyes. \\nRobert sat down again. \"Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved you both. What have you \\ndone to me? You were the one should have been king, you or Jon.\" \\n\"You had the better claim, Your Grace.\" \\n\"I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have the courtesy to listen when \\nI talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what kinging has done to me. Gods, too fat for my armor, \\nhow did it ever come to this?\" \\nPage 205\\n\\n\"Robert . . .\" \\n\"Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this \\nthrone, or so dead as now that I\\'ve won it. And Cersei . . . I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. I had no \\nwish to marry after Lyanna was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister \\nwould be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys Targaryen ever \\ntry to win back his father\\'s throne.\" The king shook his head. \"I loved that old man, I swear it, but now I \\nthink he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy. Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but cold . . . the way she \\nguards her cunt, you\\'d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs. Here, give me that \\nbeer if you won\\'t drink it.\" He took the horn, upended it, belched, wiped his mouth. \"I am sorry for your \\ngirl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. My son was lying, I\\'d stake my soul on it. My son . . . you love \\nyour children, don\\'t you?\" \\n\"With all my heart,\" Ned said. \\n\"Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up the crown. Take ship for \\nthe Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my time warring and whoring, that\\'s what I was \\nmade for. The sellsword king, how the singers would love me. You know what stops me? The thought of \\nJoffrey on the throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I have \\nmade a son like that, Ned?\" \\n\"He\\'s only a boy,\" Ned said awkwardly. He had small liking for Prince Joffrey, but he could hear the \\npain in Robert\\'s voice. \"Have you forgotten how wild you were at his age?\" \\n\"It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned. You don\\'t know him as I do.\" He sighed and shook \\nhis head. \"Ah, perhaps you are right. Jon despaired of me often enough, yet I grew into a good king.\" \\nRobert looked at Ned and scowled at his silence. \"You might speak up and agree now, you know.\" \\n\"Your Grace . . .\" Ned began, carefully. \\nRobert slapped Ned on the back. \"Ah, say that I\\'m a better king than Aerys and be done with it. You \\nnever could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark. I\\'m still young, and now that you\\'re here with me, things \\nwill be different. We\\'ll make this a reign to sing of, and damn the Lannisters to seven hells. I smell bacon. \\nWho do you think our champion will be today? Have you seen Mace Tyrell\\'s boy? The Knight of \\nFlowers, they call him. Now there\\'s a son any man would be proud to own to. Last tourney, he dumped \\nthe Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have seen the look on Cersei\\'s face. I laughed till my \\nsides hurt. Renly says he has this sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a dawn . . .\" \\nThey broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up with onions and bacon, at a \\ntrestle table by the river\\'s edge. The king\\'s melancholy melted away with the morning mist, and before \\nlong Robert was eating an orange and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been \\nboys. \". . . had given Jon a barrel of oranges, remember? Only the things had gone rotten, so I flung mine \\nacross the table and hit Dacks right in the nose. You remember, Redfort\\'s pock-faced squire? He tossed \\none back at me, and before Jon could so much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in \\nevery direction.\" He laughed uproariously, and even Ned smiled, remembering. \\nThis was the boy he had grown up with, he thought; this was the Robert Baratheon he\\'d known and \\nloved. If he could prove that the Lannisters were behind the attack on Bran, prove that they had \\nPage 206\\n\\nmurdered Jon Arryn, this man would listen. Then Cersei would fall, and the Kingslayer with her, and if \\nLord Tywin dared to rouse the west, Robert would smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on \\nthe Trident. He could see it all so clearly. \\nThat breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long time, and afterward his \\nsmiles came easier and more often, until it was time for the tournament to resume. \\nNed walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the final tilts with Sansa; Septa \\nMordane was ill today, and his daughter was determined not to miss the end of the jousting. As he saw \\nRobert to his place, he noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear; the place beside the king \\nwas empty. That too gave Ned cause to hope. \\nHe shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the horns blew for the day\\'s \\nfirst joust. Sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to notice his arrival. \\nSandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore an olivegreen \\ncloak over his soot-grey armor. That, and his hound\\'s-head helm, were his only concession to \\nornament. \\n\"A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,\" Littlefinger announced loudly as Jaime Lannister entered \\nthe lists, riding an elegant blood bay destrier. The horse wore a blanket of gilded ringmail, and Jaime \\nglittered from head to heel. Even his lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles. \\n\"Done,\" Lord Renly shouted back. \"The Hound has a hungry look about him this morning.\" \\n\"Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them,\" Littlefinger called dryly. \\nSandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible clang and took up his position. Ser Jaime tossed a \\nkiss to some woman in the commons, gently lowered his visor, and rode to the end of the lists. Both men \\ncouched their lances. \\nNed Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose, but Sansa was watching it all \\nmoist-eyed and eager. The hastily erected gallery trembled as the horses broke into a gallop. The Hound \\nleaned forward as he rode, his lance rock steady, but Jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before \\nimpact. Clegane\\'s point was turned harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion blazon, while his \\nown hit square. Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to keep his seat. Sansa gasped. A \\nragged cheer went up from the commons. \\n\"I wonder how I ought spend your money,\" Littlefinger called down to Lord Renly. \\nThe Hound just managed to stay in his saddle. He jerked his mount around hard and rode back to the \\nlists for the second pass. Jaime Lannister tossed down his broken lance and snatched up a fresh one, \\njesting with his squire. The Hound spurred forward at a hard gallop. Lannister rode to meet him. This \\ntime, when Jaime shifted his seat, Sandor Clegane shifted with him. Both lances exploded, and by the \\ntime the splinters had settled, a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of grass while Ser Jaime \\nLannister rolled in the dirt, golden and dented. \\nSansa said, \"I knew the Hound would win.\" \\nPage 207\\n\\nLittlefinger overheard. \"If you know who\\'s going to win the second match, speak up now before Lord \\nRenly plucks me clean,\" he called to her. Ned smiled. \\n\"A pity the Imp is not here with us,\" Lord Renly said. \"I should have won twice as much.\" \\nJaime Lannister was back on his feet, but his ornate lion helmet had been twisted around and dented in \\nhis fall, and now he could not get it \\noff. The commons were hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles, and \\nfailing, and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing, louder than anyone. Finally they had to lead \\nthe Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith, blind and stumbling. \\nBy then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists. He was huge, the biggest man that \\nEddard Stark had ever seen. Robert Baratheon and his brothers were all big men, as was the Hound, \\nand back at Winterfell there was a simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all, but the \\nknight they called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor. He was well over seven \\nfeet tall, closer to eight, with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks of small trees. His destrier \\nseemed a pony in between his armored legs, and the lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle. \\nUnlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man who seldom left his own \\nlands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord Tywin when King\\'s Landing fell, a new-made \\nknight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity. Some said it \\nhad been Gregor who\\'d dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and \\nwhispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the \\nsword. These things were not said in Gregor\\'s hearing. \\nNed Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon \\nGreyjoy\\'s rebellion, one knight among thousands. He watched him with disquiet. Ned seldom put much \\nstock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous. He was soon to be married \\nfor the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was said that \\nhis keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to \\nenter the hall. And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances, and the fire \\nthat had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited \\nthe keep, the gold, and the family estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take \\nservice with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, not even to \\nvisit. \\nWhen the Knight of Flowers made his entrance, a murmur ran through the crowd, and he heard Sansa\\'s \\nfervent whisper, \"Oh, he\\'s so beautifuC Ser Loras Tyrell was slender as a reed, dressed in a suit of \\nfabulous silver armor polished to a blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue \\nforget-me-nots. The commons realized \\nin the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came from sapphires; a gasp went up from a \\nthousand throats. Across the boy\\'s shoulders his cloak hung heavy. It was woven of forget-me-nots, real \\nones, hundreds of fresh blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape. \\nPage 208\\n\\nHis courser was as slim as her rider, a beautiful grey mare, built for speed. Ser Gregor\\'s huge stallion \\ntrumpeted as he caught her scent. The boy from Highgarden did something with his legs, and his horse \\npranced sideways, nimble as a dancer. Sansa clutched at his arm. \"Father, don\\'t let Ser Gregor hurt him,\" \\nshe said. Ned saw she was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had given her yesterday. Jory had told him \\nabout that as well. \\n\"These are tourney lances,\" he told his daughter. \"They make them to splinter on impact, so no one is \\nhurt.\" Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his cloak of crescent moons, and the words were \\nraw in his throat. \\nSer Gregor was having trouble controlling his horse. The stallion was screaming and pawing the ground, \\nshaking his head. The Mountain kicked at the animal savagely with an armored boot. The horse reared \\nand almost threw him. \\nThe Knight of Flowers saluted the king, rode to the far end of the list, and couched his lance, ready. Ser \\nGregor brought his animal to the line, fighting with the reins. And suddenly it began. The Mountain\\'s \\nstallion broke in a hard gallop, plunging forward wildly, while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of \\nsilk. Ser Gregor wrenched his shield into position, juggled with his lance, and all the while fought to hold \\nhis unruly mount on a straight line, and suddenly Loras Tyrell was on him, placing the point of his lance \\njust there, and in an eye blink the Mountain was failing. He was so huge that he took his horse down with \\nhim in a tangle of steel and flesh. \\nNed heard applause, cheers, whistles, shocked gasps, excited muttering, and over it all the rasping, \\nraucous laughter of the Hound. The Knight of Flowers reined up at the end of the lists. His lance was not \\neven broken. His sapphires winked in the sun as he raised his visor, smiling. The commons went mad for \\nhim. \\nIn the middle of the field, Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled himself and came boiling to his feet. He \\nwrenched off his helm and slammed it down onto the ground. His face was dark with fury and his hair fell \\ndown into his eyes. \"My sword,\" he shouted to his squire, and the boy ran it out to him. By then his \\nstallion was back on its feet as well. \\nGregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half severed the animal\\'s neck. \\nCheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat. The stallion went to its knees, screaming as it died. By then \\nGregor was striding down the lists toward Ser Loras Tyrell, his bloody sword clutched in his fist. \"Stop \\nhim!\" Ned shouted, but his words were lost in the roar. Everyone else was yelling as well, and Sansa was \\ncrying. \\nIt all happened so fast. The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword as Ser Gregor knocked \\nhis squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse. The mare scented blood and reared. Loras \\nTyrell kept his seat, but barely. Ser Gregor swung his sword, a savage twohanded blow that took the \\nboy in the chest and knocked him from the saddle. The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras lay \\nstunned in the dirt. But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow, a rasping voice warned, \"Leave him \\nbe, \" and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the boy. \\nThe Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing arc with all his massive \\nstrength behind it, but the Hound caught the blow and turned it, and for what seemed an eternity the two \\nbrothers stood hammering at each other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw \\nPage 209\\n\\nSer Gregor aim savage blows at the hound\\'s-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his \\nbrother\\'s unprotected face. \\nIt was the king\\'s voice that put an end to it . . . the king\\'s voice and twenty swords. Jon Arryn had told \\nthem that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, and Robert had proved the truth of that on the \\nTrident. He used that voice now. \"STOP THIS MADNESS, \" he boomed, \"IN THE NAME OF \\nYOUR KING!\" \\nThe Hound went to one knee. Ser Gregor\\'s blow cut air, and at last he came to his senses. He dropped \\nhis sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by his Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen. \\nWordlessly, he turned and strode off, shoving past Barristan Selmy. \"Let him go,\" Robert said, and as \\nquickly as that, it was over. \\n\"Is the Hound the champion now?\" Sansa asked Ned. \\n\"No,\" he told her. \"There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the Knight of Flowers.\" \\nBut Sansa had the right of it after all. A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell walked back onto the field in \\na simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane, \"I owe you my life. The day is yours, ser.\" \\n\"I am no ser,\" the Hound replied, but he took the victory, and the champion\\'s purse, and, for perhaps the \\nfirst time in his life, the love of the commons. They cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion. \\nAs Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly and some of the others fell in \\nwith them. \"Tyrell had to \\nknow the mare was in heat,\" Littlefinger was saying. \"I swear the boy planned the whole thing. Gregor \\nhas always favored huge, ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense.\" The notion seemed to amuse \\nhim. \\nIt did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy. \"There is small honor in tricks,\" the old man said stiffly. \\n\"Small honor and twenty thousand golds.\" Lord Renly smiled. \\nThat afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the Dornish Marches, won the \\narchery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the \\nother bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him \\na position with the Hand\\'s guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, \\nand he refused. \\nThe melee went on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and hedge knights and \\nnew-made squires in search of a reputation. They fought with blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and \\nblood, small troops fighting together and then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured, \\nuntil only one man was left standing. The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who \\nshaved his head and fought with a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the fire sword frightened \\nthe mounts of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. The final tally was three broken limbs, a \\nshattered collarbone, a dozen smashed fingers, two horses that had to be put down, and more cuts, \\nsprains, and bruises than anyone cared to count. Ned was desperately pleased that Robert had not taken \\npart. \\nPage 210\\n\\nThat night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a great while. Robert was in \\nhigh good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be seen, and even his daughters were behaving. Jory \\nbrought Arya down to join them, and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly. \"The tournament was \\nmagnificent,\" she sighed. \"You should have come. How was your dancing?\" \\n\"I\\'m sore all over,\" Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple bruise on her leg. \\n\"You must be a terrible dancer,\" Sansa said doubtfully. \\nLater, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the complex round of interwoven \\nballads called the \"Dance of the Dragons,\" Ned inspected the bruise himself. \"I hope Forel is not being \\ntoo hard on you,\" he said. \\nArya stood on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. \"Syrio says that every hurt is a lesson, \\nand every lesson makes you better.\" \\nNed frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi \\nstyle was well suited to Arya\\'s slender blade, yet still . . . a few days ago, she had been wandering \\naround with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes. Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her \\nnose and her skin, she told him. Before that, he had her doing spins and back flips. \"Arya, are you certain \\nyou want to persist in this?\" \\nShe nodded. \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to catch cats.\" \\n\"Cats.\" Ned sighed. \"Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask Jory to take \\nover your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven \\nKingdoms in his youth.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want them,\" Arya said. \"I want Syrio.\" \\nNed ran his fingers through his hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give Arya the rudiments of \\nslash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, cartwheels, and hopping about on one leg, but he \\nknew his youngest daughter well enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw. \"As \\nyou wish,\" he said. Surely she would grow tired of this soon. \"Try to be careful.\" \\n\"I will,\" she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to her left. \\nMuch later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them both safe in bed, Sansa with \\nher dreams and Arya with her bruises, Ned ascended to his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand. \\nThe day had been warm and the room was close and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the \\nheavy shutters to let in the cool night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering glow of \\ncandlelight from Littlefinger\\'s windows. The hour was well past midnight. Down by the river, the revels \\nwere only now beginning to dwindle and die. \\nHe took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger\\'s blade, won by Tyrion Lannister in a tourney wager, \\nsent to slay Bran in his sleep. Why? Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? Why would anyone want \\nBran dead? \\nPage 211\\n\\nThe dagger, Bran\\'s fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon Arryn, he could feel it in his \\ngut, but the truth of Jon\\'s death remained as clouded to him as when he had started. Lord Stannis had not \\nreturned to King\\'s Landing for the tourney. Lysa Arryn held her silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie. \\nThe squire was dead, and Jory was still searching the whorehouses. What did he have but Robert\\'s \\nbastard? \\nThat the armorer\\'s sullen apprentice was the king\\'s son, Ned had no \\ndoubt. The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. Renly was too \\nyoung to have fathered a boy of that age, Stannis too cold and proud in his honor. Gendry had to be \\nRobert\\'s. \\nYet knowing all that, what had he learned? The king had other baseborn children scattered throughout \\nthe Seven Kingdoms. He had openly acknowledged one of his bastards, a boy of Bran\\'s age whose \\nmother was highborn. The lad was being fostered by Lord Renly\\'s castellan at Storm\\'s End. \\nNed remembered Robert\\'s first child as well, a daughter born in the Vale when Robert was scarcely \\nmore than a boy himself. A sweet little girl; the young lord of Storm\\'s End had doted on her. He used to \\nmake daily visits to play with the babe, long after he had lost interest in the mother. Ned was often \\ndragged along for company, whether he willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, he \\nrealized; older than Robert had been when he fathered her. A strange thought. \\nCersei could not have been pleased by her lord husband\\'s by-blows, yet in the end it mattered little \\nwhether the king had one bastard or a hundred. Law and custom gave the baseborn few rights. Gendry, \\nthe girl in the Vale, the boy at Storm\\'s End, none of them could threaten Robert\\'s trueborn children . . . \\nHis musings were ended by a soft rap on his door. \"A man to see you, my lord,\" Harwin called. \"He will \\nnot give his name.\" \\n\"Send him in,\" Ned said, wondering. \\nThe visitor was a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown robe of the coarsest \\nroughspun, his features hidden by a cowl, his hands drawn up into voluminous sleeves. \\n\"Who are you?\" Ned asked. \\n\"A friend,\" the cowled man said in a strange, low voice. \"We must speak alone, Lord Stark.\" \\nCuriosity was stronger than caution. \"Harwin, leave us,\" he commanded. Not until they were alone \\nbehind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl. \\n\"Lord Varys?\" Ned said in astonishment. \\n\"Lord Stark,\" Varys said politely, seating himself. \"I wonder if I might trouble you for a drink?\" \\nNed filled two cups with surnmerwine and handed one to Varys. \"I might have passed within a foot of \\nyou and never recognized you,\" he said, incredulous. He had never seen the eunuch dress in anything but \\nsilk and velvet and the richest damasks, and this man smelled of sweat instead of lilacs. \\nPage 212\\n\\n\"That was my dearest hope,\" Varys said. \"It would not do if certain people learned that we had spoken \\nin private. The queen watches you closely. This wine is very choice. Thank you.\" \\n\"How did you get past my other guards?\" Ned asked. Porther and Cayn had been posted outside the \\ntower, and Alyn on the stairs. \\n\"The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.\" Varys smiled apologetically. \"I will not \\nkeep you long, my lord. There are things you must know. You are the King\\'s Hand, and the king is a \\nfool.\" The eunuch\\'s cloying tones were gone; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip. \"Your friend, I \\nknow, yet a fool nonetheless . . . and doomed, unless you save him. Today was a near thing. They had \\nhoped to kill him during the melee.\" \\nFor a moment Ned was speechless with shock. \"Who?\" \\nVarys sipped his wine. \"If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool than Robert and I am on the \\nwrong side.\" \\n\"The Lannisters,\" Ned said. \"The queen . . . no, I will not believe that, not even of Cersei. She asked him \\nnot to fight!\" \\n\"She forbade him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the court. Tell me truly, do you \\nknow any surer way to force King Robert into the melee? I ask you.\" \\nNed had a sick feeling in his gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert Baratheon he could not, \\nshould not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as done. \"Even if he\\'d fought, who would have \\ndared to strike the king?\" \\nVarys shrugged. \"There were forty riders in the melee. The Lannisters have many friends. Amidst all that \\nchaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of \\nhis, who could name it murder if some chance blow felled His Grace?\" He went to the flagon and refilled \\nhis cup. \"After the deed was done, the slayer would be beside himself with grief. I can almost hear him \\nweeping. So sad. Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate widow would take pity, lift the poor \\nunfortunate to his feet, and bless him with a gentle kiss of forgiveness. Good King Joffrey would have no \\nchoice but to pardon him.\" The eunuch stroked his cheek. \"Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike \\noff his head. Less risk for the Lannisters that way, though quite an unpleasant surprise for their little \\nfriend.\" \\nNed felt his anger rise. \"You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.\" \\n\"I command whisperers, not warriors.\" \\n\"You might have come to me earlier.\" \\n\"Oh, yes, I confess it. And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes? And when Robert heard of \\nhis peril, what would he have done? I wonder.\" \\nNed considered that. \"He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to show he did not fear \\nPage 213\\n\\nthem.\" \\nVarys spread his hands. \"I will make another confession, Lord Eddard. I was curious to see what you \\nwould do. Why not come to me? you ask, and I must answer, Why, because I did not trust you, my lord. \\n\"You did not trust me?\" Ned was frankly astonished. \\n\"The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,\" Varys said. \"Those who are loyal to the \\nrealm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. Until this morning, I could not say which you might be \\n. . . so I waited to see . . . and now I know, for a certainty.\" He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a \\nmoment his private face and public mask were one. \"I begin to comprehend why the queen fears you so \\nmuch. Oh, yes I do.\" \\n\"You are the one she ought to fear,\" Ned said. \\n\"No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him. A most puissant warrior is our \\nRobert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and spies and eunuchs. If a day should come \\nwhen Cersei whispers, \\'Kill that man,\\' Ilyn Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling, and who will \\nmourn poor Varys then? North or south, they sing no songs for spiders.\" He reached out and touched \\nNed with a soft hand. \"But you, Lord Stark . . . I think . . . no, I know . . . he would not kill you, not \\neven for his queen, and there may lie our salvation.\" \\nIt was all too much. For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to return to Winterfell, to \\nthe clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall. \\n\"Surely Robert has other loyal friends,\" he protested. \"His brothers, his-\" \\n,,-wife?\" Varys finished, with a smile that cut. \"His brothers hate the Lannisters, true enough, but hating \\nthe queen and loving the king are not quite the same thing, are they? Ser Barristan loves his honor, Grand \\nMaester Pycelle loves his office, and Littlefinger loves Littlefinger.\" \\n\"The Kingsguard-\" \\n\"A paper shield,\" the eunuch said. \"Try not to look so shocked, Lord Stark. Jaime Lannister is himself a \\nSworn Brother of the White Swords, and we all know what his oath is worth. The days when men like \\nRyam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight wore the \\nwhite cloak are gone to dust and song. Of these seven, only Ser Barristan Selmy is made of the true \\nsteel, and Selmy is old. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen\\'s creatures to the bone, and I have deep \\nsuspicions of the others. No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true \\nfriend Robert Baratheon will have.\" \\n\"Robert must be told,\" Ned said. \"If what you say is true, if even a part of it is true, the king must hear it \\nfor himself.\" \\n\"And what proof shall we lay before him? My words against theirs? My little birds against the queen and \\nthe Kingslayer, against his brothers and his council, against the Wardens of East and West, against all the \\nmight of Casterly Rock? Pray, send for Ser Ilyn directly, it will save us all some time. I know where that \\nroad ends.\" \\nPage 214\\n\\n\"Yet if what you say is true, they will only bide their time and make another attempt.\" \\n\"Indeed they will,\" said Varys, \"and sooner rather than later, I do fear. You are making them most \\nanxious, Lord Eddard. But my little birds will be listening, and together we may be able to forestall them, \\nyou and U\\' He rose and pulled up his cowl so his face was hidden once more. \"Thank you for the wine. \\nWe will speak again. When you see me next at council, be certain to treat me with your accustomed \\ncontempt. You should not find it difficult.\" \\nHe was at the door when Ned called, \"Varys. \" The eunuch turned back. \"How did Jon Arryn die?\" \\n\"I wondered when you would get around to that.\" \\n\"Tell me.\" \\n\"The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as water, and it leaves no trace. I \\nbegged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I begged him, but he would not hear of it. Only one \\nwho was less than a man would even think of such a thing, he told me.\" \\nNed had to know the rest. \"Who gave him the poison?\" \\n\"Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt. Oh, but which one? \\nThere were many such. Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting man.\" The eunuch sighed. \"There was one boy. \\nAll he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in \\nKing\\'s Landing and prospered. It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.\" The whip \\nwas in his voice again, every word a stroke. \"He must have cut a gallant figure in the tourney, him in his \\nbright new armor, with those crescent moons on his cloak. A pity he died so untimely, before you could \\ntalk to him . . .\" \\nNed felt half-poisoned himself. \"The squire,\" he said. \"Ser Hugh.\" Wheels within wheels within wheels. \\nNed\\'s head was pounding. \"\"y? Why now? Jon Arryn had been Hand for fourteen years. What was he \\ndoing that they had to kill him?\" \\n\"Asking questions,\" Varys said, slipping out the door. \\nTYRION \\nAs he stood in the predawn chill watching Chiggen butcher his horse, Tyrion Lannister chalked up one \\nmore debt owed the Starks. Steam rose from inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the \\nbelly with his skinning knife. His hands moved deftly, with never a wasted cut; the work had to be done \\nquickly, before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights. \\n\"None of us will go hungry tonight,\" Bronn said. He was near a shadow himself; bone thin and bone \\nhard, with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of beard. \\n\"Some of us may,\" Tyrion told him. \"I am not fond of eating horse. Particularly my horse.\" \\n\"Meat is meat,\" Bronn said with a shrug. \"The Dothraki like horse more than beef or pork.\" \\nPage 215\\n\\n\"Do you take me for a Dothraki?\" Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate horse, in truth; they also left \\ndeformed children out for the feral dogs who ran behind their khalasars. Dothraki customs had scant \\nappeal for him. \\nChiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for inspection. \"Want a taste, \\ndwarf?\" \\n\"My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day,\" Tyrion said in a flat voice. \\n\"Thank him for us, then. If you ever see him again.\" Chiggen grinned, showing yellow teeth, and \\nswallowed the raw meat in two bites. \"Tastes well bred.\" \\n\"Better if you fry it up with onions,\" Bronn put in. \\nWordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The cold had settled deep in his bones, and his legs were so sore he \\ncould scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky one. He had hours more riding ahead of him, \\nfollowed by a few mouthfuls of food and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the \\nsame, and another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. \"Damn her,\" he muttered as \\nhe struggled up the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, \"damn her and all the Starks.\" \\nThe memory was still bitter. One moment he\\'d been ordering supper, and an eye blink later he was \\nfacing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword and the fat innkeep shrieking, \"No swords, \\nnot here, please, m\\'lords.\" \\nTyrion wrenched down Jyck\\'s arm hurriedly, before he got them both hacked to pieces. \"Where are \\nyour courtesies, Jyck? Our good hostess said no swords. Do as she asks.\" He forced a smile that must \\nhave looked as queasy as it felt. \"You\\'re making a sad mistake, Lady Stark. I had no part in any attack \\non your son. On my honor-\" \\n\"Lannister honor,\" was all she said. She held up her hands for all the room to see. \"His dagger left these \\nscars. The blade he sent to open my son\\'s throat.\" \\nTyrion felt the anger all around him, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in the Stark woman\\'s hands. \\n\"Kill him,\" hissed some drunken slattern from the back, and other voices took up the call, faster than he \\nwould have believed. Strangers all, friendly enough only a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his \\nblood like hounds on a trail. \\nTyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. \"If Lady Stark believes I have some \\ncrime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for it.\" \\nIt was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure invitation to an early grave. \\nA good dozen swords had responded to the Stark woman\\'s plea for help: the Harrenhal man, the three \\nBrackens, a pair of unsavory sellswords who looked as though they\\'d kill him as soon as spit, and some \\nfool field hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing. Against that, what did Tyrion have? A \\ndagger at his belt, and two men. Jyck swung a fair enough sword, but Morrec scarcely counted; he was \\npart groom, part cook, part body servant, and no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever his feelings might have \\nPage 216\\n\\nbeen, the black brothers were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm. Yoren would do \\nnothing. \\nAnd indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by Catelyn Stark\\'s side said, \\n\"Take their weapons,\" and the sellsword Bronn stepped forward to pull the sword from Jyck\\'s fingers \\nand relieve them all of their daggers. \"Good,\" the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed \\npalpably, \"excellent.\" Tyrion recognized the gruff voice; Winterfell\\'s master-at-arms, shorn of his \\nwhiskers. \\nScarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep\\'s mouth as she begged of Catelyn Stark, \"Don\\'t kill him \\nhere!\" \\n\"Don\\'t kill him anywhere,\" Tyrion urged. \\n\"Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m1ady, I wants no high lordlin\\'s quarrels.\" \\n\"We are taking him back to Winterfell,\" she said, and Tyrion thought, Well, perhaps . . . By then he\\'d \\nhad a moment to glance over the room and get a better idea of the situation. He was not altogether \\ndispleased by what he saw. Oh, the Stark woman had been clever, no doubt of it. Force them to make a \\npublic affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on them for succor, \\nand her a woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as complete as she might have liked. \\nThere were close to fifty in the common room by his rough count. Catelyn Stark\\'s plea had roused a bare \\ndozen; the others looked confused, or frightened, or sullen. Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion \\nnoted, and they\\'d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move. He might have smiled if \\nhe\\'d dared. \\n\"Winterfell it is, then,\" he said instead. That was a long ride, as he could well attest, having just ridden it \\nthe other way. So many things could happen along the way. \"My father will wonder what has become of \\nme,\" he added, catching the eye of the swordsman who\\'d offered to yield up his room. \"He\\'ll pay a \\nhandsome reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today.\" Lord Tywin would \\ndo no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he won free. \\nSer Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be. \"His men come with him,\" the old \\nknight announced. \"And we\\'ll thank the rest of you to stay quiet about what you\\'ve seen here.\" \\nIt was all Tyrion could do not to laugh. Quiet? The old fool. Unless he took the whole inn, the word \\nwould begin to spread the instant they were gone. The freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly \\nto Casterly Rock like an arrow. If not him, then someone else. Yoren \\nwould carry the story south. That fool singer might make a lay of it. The Freys would report back to \\ntheir lord, and the gods only knew what he might do. Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but \\nhe was a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the winning side. \\nAt the very least he would send his birds winging south to King\\'s Landing, and he might well dare more \\nthan that. \\nCatelyn Stark wasted no time. \"We must ride at once. We\\'ll want fresh mounts, and provisions for the \\nroad. You men, know that you have the eternal gratitude of House Stark. If any of you choose to help us \\nguard our captives and get them safe to Winterfell, I promise you shall be well rewarded.\" That was all it \\nPage 217\\n\\ntook; the fools came rushing forward. Tyrion studied their faces; they would indeed be well rewarded, he \\nvowed to himself, but perhaps not quite as they imagined. \\nYet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, and tying his hands with a \\nlength of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly afraid. They would never get him to Winterfell, he \\nwould have given odds on that. Riders would be after them within the day, birds would take wing, and \\nsurely one of the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand. Tyrion was \\ncongratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood down over his eyes and lifted him up \\nonto a saddle. \\nThey set out through the rain at a hard gallop, and before long Tyrion\\'s thighs were cramped and aching \\nand his butt throbbed with pain. Even when they were safely away from the inn, and Catelyn Stark \\nslowed them to a trot, it was a miserable pounding journey over rough ground, made worse by his \\nblindness. Every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled sound, so he \\ncould not make out what was being said around him, and the rain soaked through the cloth and made it \\ncling to his face, until even breathing was a struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow \\ntighter as the night wore on. I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl, and that \\nwretched singer had to open his mouth, he thought mournfully. The wretched singer had come along with \\nthem. \"There is a great song to be made from this, and I\\'m the one to make it,\" he told Catelyn Stark \\nwhen he announced his intention of riding with them to see how the \"splendid adventure\" turned out. \\nTyrion wondered whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister riders \\ncaught up with them. \\nThe rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth over his eyes when \\nCatelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands pulled him down from his horse, untied his \\nwrists, and yanked the hood off his head. When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high \\nand wild all around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope went out \\nof him in a rush. \"This is the high road,\" he gasped, looking at Lady Stark with accusation. \"The eastem \\nroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell!\" \\nCatelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. \"Often and loudly,\" she agreed. \"No doubt your \\nfriends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish them good speed.\" \\nEven now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his life Tyrion had prided himself \\non his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to give him, and yet this seven-times-damned shewolf \\nCatelyn Stark had outwitted him at every turn. The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his \\nabduction. \\nThey stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then they were off again. This \\ntime Tyrion was spared the hood. After the second night they no longer bound his hands, and once they \\nhad gained the heights they scarcely bothered to guard him at all. It seemed they did not fear his escape. \\nAnd why should they? Up here the land was harsh and wild, and the high road little more than a stony \\ntrack. If he did run, how far could he hope to go, alone and without provisions? The shadowcats would \\nmake a morsel of him, and the clans that dwelt in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers \\nwho bowed to no law but the sword. \\nYet still the Stark woman drove them forward relentlessly. He knew where they were bound. He had \\nknown it since the moment they pulled off his hood. These mountains were the domain of House Arryn, \\nPage 218\\n\\nand the late Hand\\'s widow was a Tully, Catelyn Stark\\'s sister . . . and no friend to the Lannisters. Tyrion \\nhad known the Lady Lysa slightly during her years at King\\'s Landing, and did not look forward to \\nrenewing the acquaintance. \\nHis captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road. The horses had drunk \\ntheir fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of brown grass that grew from clefts in the \\nrock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, sullen and miserable. Mohor stood over them, leaning on his \\nspear and wearing a rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby, \\nMarillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of what the damp was doing to his strings. \\n\"We must have some rest, my lady,\" the hedge knight Ser Willis Wode was saying to Catelyn Stark as \\nTyrion approached. He was Lady \\nWhent\\'s man, stiff-necked and stolid, and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn. \\n\"Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,\" Ser Rodrik said. \"This is the third horse we have lost-\" \\n\"We will lose more than horses if we\\'re overtaken by the Lannisters,\" she reminded them. Her face was \\nwindburnt and gaunt, but it had lost none of its determination. \\n\"Small chance of that here,\" Tyrion put in. \\n\"The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,\" snapped Kurleket, a great fat oaf with short-cropped hair and \\na pig\\'s face. He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-arms in the service of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made \\na special effort to learn all their names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A \\nLannister always paid his debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as would his friends Lharys and \\nMohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. He planned an especially sharp \\nlesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to \\nrhyme imp with gimp and limp so he could make a song of this outrage. \\n\"Let him speak,\" Lady Stark commanded. \\nTyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock. \"By now our pursuit is likely racing across the Neck, chasing \\nyour lie up the kingsroad . . . assuming there is a pursuit, which is by no means certain. Oh, no doubt the \\nword has reached my father . . . but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that \\nhe will bother to bestir himself.\" It was only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not a fig for his \\ndeformed son, but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House. \"This is a cruel land, Lady Stark. \\nYou\\'ll find no succor until you reach the Vale, and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more. \\nWorse, you risk losing me. I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then what\\'s the point?\" That was no lie \\nat all; Tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure this pace. \\n\"It might be said that your death is the point, Lannister,\" Catelyn Stark replied. \\n\"I think not,\" Tyrion said. \"If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the word, and one of these \\nstaunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red smile.\" He looked at Kurleket, but the man \\nwas too dim to taste the mockery. \\n\"The Starks do not murder men in their beds.\" \\nPage 219\\n\\n\"Nor do I,\" he said.-I tell you again, I had no part in the attempt to kill your son.\" \\n\"The assassin was armed with your dagger.\" \\nTyrion felt the heat rise in him. \"It was not my dagger,\" he insisted. \"How many times must I swear to \\nthat? Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I am not a stupid man. Only a fool would arm a \\ncommon footpad with his own blade.\" \\nJust for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what she said was, \"Why would \\nPetyr lie to me?\" \\n\"Why does a bear shit in the woods?\" he demanded. \"Because it is his nature. Lying comes as easily as \\nbreathing to a man like Littlefinger. You ought to know that, you of all people.\" \\nShe took a step toward him, her face tight. \"And what does that mean, Lannister?\" \\nTyrion cocked his head. \"Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he took your maidenhead, my \\nlady.\" \\n\"That is a lie!\" Catelyn Stark said. \\n\"Oh, wicked little imp,\" Marillion said, shocked. \\nKurleket drew his dirk, a vicious piece of black iron. \"At your word, m\\'lady, I\\'ll toss his lying tongue at \\nyour feet.\" His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the prospect. \\nCatelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had never seen. \"Petyr Baelish \\nloved me once. He was only a boy. His passion was a tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and \\nnothing to be made mock of. He wanted my hand. That is the truth of the matter. You are truly an evil \\nman, Lannister.\" \\n\"And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark. Littlefinger has never loved anyone but Littlefinger, and I promise \\nyou that it is not your hand that he boasts of, it\\'s those ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and \\nthe heat between your legs.\" \\nKurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk, baring his throat. Tyrion felt \\nthe cold kiss of steel beneath his chin. \"Shall I bleed him, my lady?\" \\n\"Kill me and the truth dies with me,\" Tyrion gasped. \\n\"Let him talk,\" Catelyn Stark commanded. \\nKurleket let go of Tyrion\\'s hair, reluctantly. \\nTyrion took a deep breath. \"How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this dagger of his? Answer me that.\" \\n\"You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey\\'s name day.\" \\n\"When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his story, no?\" \\nPage 220\\n\\n\"It was,\" she admitted. A line creased her brow. \\n\"Riders!\" \\nThe shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them. Ser \\nRodrik had sent Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest. \\nFor a long second, no one moved. Catelyn Stark was the first to react. \"Ser Rodrik, Ser Willis, to \\nhorse,\" she shouted. \"Get the other mounts behind us. Mohor, guard the prisoners-\" \\n\"Arm us!\" Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm. \"You will need every sword.\" \\nShe knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing for the enmities of the \\ngreat houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with equal fervor, as they slaughtered each other. \\nThey might spare Catelyn herself; she was still young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated. \\n\"I hear them!\" Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and there it was: hoofbeats, a \\ndozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone was moving, reaching for weapons, running to \\ntheir mounts. \\nPebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down the ridge. He landed \\nbreathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking \\nout from under a conical steel cap. \"Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,\" he said, breathless. \"Milk Snakes \\nor Moon Brothers, by my guess. They must have eyes out, m1ady . . . hidden watchers . . . they know \\nwe\\'re here.\" \\nSer Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand. Mohor crouched behind a boulder, both \\nhands on his iron-tipped spear, a dagger between his teeth. \"You, singer,\" Ser Willis Wode called out. \\n\"Help me with this breastplate.\" Marillion sat frozen, clutching his woodharp, his face as pale as milk, but \\nTyrion\\'s man Morrec bounded quickly to his feet and moved to help the knight with his armor. \\nTyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark. \"You have no choice,\" he told her. \"Three of us, and a fourth man \\nwasted guarding us . . . four men can be the difference between life and death up here.\" \\n\"Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight is done.\" \\n\"My word?\" The hoofbeats were louder now. Tyrion grinned crookedly. \"Oh, that you have, my lady . . \\n. on my honor as a Lannister.\" \\nFor a moment he thought she would spit at him, but instead she snapped, \"Arm them,\" and as quick as \\nthat she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the \\nfoe. Morrec helped himself to a bow and quiver, and went to one knee beside the road. He was a better \\narcher than swordsman. And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe. \\n\"I have never fought with an axe.\" The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar in his hands. It had a short \\nPage 221\\n\\nhaft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top. \\n\"Pretend you\\'re splitting logs,\" Bronn said, drawing his longsword from the scabbard across his back. \\nHe spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and Ser Rodrik. Ser Willis mounted up to join them, \\nfumbling with his helmet, a metal pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume. \\n\"Logs don\\'t bleed,\" Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without armor. He looked around \\nfor a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding. \"Move over.\" \\n\"Go away!\" the boy screamed back at him. \"I\\'m a singer, I want no part of this fight!\" \\n\"What, lost your taste for adventure?\" Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid over, and not a moment \\ntoo soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them. \\nThere were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of bowstrings as Morrec and \\nLharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled \\nleather and mismatched armor, faces hidden behind barred halffielms. In gloved hands were clutched all \\nmanner of weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers and heavy \\niron mauls. At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, armed with a two-handed \\ngreatsword. \\nSer Rodrik shouted \"Winterfell!\" and rode to meet him, with Bronn and Chiggen beside him, screaming \\nsome wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around his head. \\n\"Harrenhal! Harrenhal!\" he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out, \\n\"Casterly Rock!\" but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower. \\nHe heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. Chiggen\\'s sword raked \\nacross the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged through the clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting \\ndown foes right and left. Ser Rodrik hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses \\ndancing round each other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped \\nbareback into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the shadowskin cloak. \\nWhen he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting \\nsomeone else. \\nSuddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse leapt over their rock. \\nTyrion scrambled to his feet as the \\nrider turned to come back at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The \\nblade caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty thunk, angling upward, and Tyrion almost lost \\nhis grip as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out \\nof the way. Marillion was less fortunate. Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the \\nsinger. Tyrion danced back in while the brigand\\'s leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount, and buried \\nthe axe in the man\\'s neck, just above the shoulder blades. \\nAs he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the bodies. \"Someone help \\nme,\" the singer gasped. \"Gods have mercy, I\\'m bleeding.\" \\n\"I believe that\\'s horse blood,\" Tyrion said. The singer\\'s hand came crawling out from beneath the dead \\nanimal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs. Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt \\nPage 222\\n\\na satisfying crunch. \"Close your eyes and pretend you\\'re dead,\" he advised the singer before he hefted \\nthe axe and turned away. \\nAfter that, things ran together. The dawn was full of shouts and screams and heavy with the scent of \\nblood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed past his ear and clattered off the rocks. He \\nsaw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a sword in each hand. Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight, sliding \\nfrom rock to rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a \\nwounded clansman and left him dead, helping himself to the man\\'s halfhelm. It fit too snugly, but Tyrion \\nwas glad of any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from behind while he sliced at a man in front of him, \\nand later Tyrion stumbled over Kurleket\\'s body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but \\nTyrion recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man\\'s dead fingers. He was sliding it through his belt \\nwhen he heard a woman\\'s scream. \\nCatelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three men around her, one still \\nmounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands, but her \\nback was to the rock now and they had penned her on three sides. Let them have the bitch, Tyrion \\nthought, and welcome to her, yet somehow he was moving. He caught the first man in the back of the \\nknee before they even knew he was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh and bone like rotten wood. \\nLogs that bleed, Tyrion thought inanely as the second man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword, \\nlashed out with the axe, the man reeled backward . . . and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and \\nopened his throat. The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off \\nsuddenly. \\nTyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow the fighting had ended \\nwhen he wasn\\'t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay all around, screaming or moaning. To his \\nvast astonishment, he was not one of them. He opened his fingers and let the axe thunk to the ground. His \\nhands were sticky with blood. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but the sun \\nseemed scarcely to have moved at all. \\n\"Your first battle?\" Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck\\'s body, pulling off his boots. They were good \\nboots, as befit one of Lord Tywin\\'s men; heavy leather, oiled and supple, much finer than what Bronn \\nwas wearing. \\nTyrion nodded. \"My father will be so proud,\" he said. His legs were cramping so badly he could \\nscarcely stand. Odd, he had never once noticed the pain during the battle. \\n\"You need a woman now,\" Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes. He shoved the boots into his \\nsaddlebag. \"Nothing like a woman after a man\\'s been blooded, take my word.\" \\nChiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and lick his lips. \\nTyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik\\'s wounds. \"I\\'m willing if she is,\" he \\nsaid. The freeriders broke into laughter, and Tyrion grinned and thought, There\\'s a start. \\nAfterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water cold as ice. As he limped \\nback to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead clansmen were thin, ragged men, their horses \\nscrawny and undersized, with every rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were \\nnone too impressive. Mauls, clubs, a scythe . . . He remembered the big man in the shadowskin cloak \\nwho had dueled Ser Rodrik with a two-handed greatsword, but when he found his corpse sprawled on \\nPage 223\\n\\nthe stony ground, the man was not so big after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade \\nwas badly notched, its cheap steel spotted with rust. Small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on \\nthe ground. \\nThey had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken\\'s men-at-arms, Kurleket and Mohor, and his own man \\nJyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback charge. A fool to the end, Tyrion thought. \\n\"Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,\" Ser Willis Wode said, his eyes scanning the \\nridgetops warily through the slit in his helm. \"We drove them off for the moment, but they will not have \\ngone far.\" \\n\"We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,\" she said. \"These were brave men. I will not leave them to the \\ncrows and shadowcats.\" \\n\"This soil is too stony for digging,\" Ser Willis said. \\n\"Then we shall gather stones for cairns.\" \\n\"Gather all the stones you want,\" Bronn told her, \"but do it without me or Chiggen. I\\'ve better things to \\ndo than pile rocks on dead men . . . breathing, for one.\" He looked over the rest of the survivors. \"Any of \\nyou who hope to be alive come nightfall, ride with us.\" \\n\"My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,\" Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight had been wounded in the \\nfight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that grazed his neck, and he sounded his age. \"If we \\nlinger here, they will be on us again for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack.\" \\nTyrion could see the anger in Catelyn\\'s face, but she had no choice. \"May the gods forgive us, then. We \\nwill ride at once.\" \\nThere was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck\\'s spotted gelding, who looked \\nstrong enough to last another three or four days at least. He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up \\nand said, \"I\\'ll take that dirk now, dwarf.\" \\n\"Let him keep it.\" Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. \"And see that he has his axe back as well. \\nWe may have need of it if we are attacked again.\" \\n\"You have my thanks, lady,\" Tyrion said, mounting up. \\n\"Save them,\" she said curtly. \"I trust you no more than I did before.\" She was gone before he could \\nframe a reply. \\nTyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered how he had begun the \\njourney, with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over his head, and decided that this was a definite \\nimprovement. Lady Stark could keep her trust; so long as he could keep the axe, he would count himself \\nahead in the game. \\nSer Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in the middle, Ser Rodrik a \\nshadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks back at Tyrion as they rode. The singer had \\nbroken several ribs, his woodharp, and all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an \\nPage 224\\n\\nutter loss to him; somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur slashed by \\nstripes of white. He huddled beneath its folds silently, and for once had nothing to say. \\nThey heard the deep growls of shadowcats behind them before they had gone half a mile, and later the \\nwild snarling of the beasts fighting over the corpses they had left behind. Marillion grew visibly pale. \\nTyrion trotted up beside him. \"Craven, \" he said, \"rhymes nicely with raven.\" He kicked his horse and \\nmoved past the singer, up to Ser Rodrik and Catelyn Stark. \\nShe looked at him, lips pressed tightly together. \\n\"As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted,\" Tyrion began, \"there is a serious flaw in \\nLittlefinger\\'s fable. Whatever you may believe of me, Lady Stark, I promise you this-1 never bet against \\nmy family.\" \\nARYA \\nThe one-eared black tom arched his back and hissed at her. \\nArya padded down the alley, balanced lightly on the balls of her bare feet, listening to the flutter of her \\nheart, breathing slow deep breaths. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself, light as a feather. The tomcat \\nwatched her come, his eyes wary. \\nCatching cats was hard. Her hands were covered with half-healed scratches, and both knees were \\nscabbed over where she had scraped them raw in tumbles. At first even the cook\\'s huge fat kitchen cat \\nhad been able to elude her, but Syrio had kept her at it day and night. When she\\'d run to him with her \\nhands bleeding, he had said, \"So slow? Be quicker, girl. Your enemies will give you more than \\nscratches.\" He had dabbed her wounds with Myrish fire, which burned so bad she had had to bite her lip \\nto keep from screaming. Then he sent her out after more cats. \\nThe Red Keep was full of cats: lazy old cats dozing in the sun, coldeyed mousers twitching their tails, \\nquick little kittens with claws like needles, ladies\\' cats all combed and trusting, ragged shadows prowling \\nthe midden heaps. One by one Arya had chased them down and snatched them up and brought them \\nproudly to Syrio Forel . . . all but this one, this one-eared black devil of a tomcat. \"That\\'s the real king of \\nthis castle right there,\" one of the gold cloaks had told her. \"Older than sin and twice as mean. One time, \\nthe king was feasting the \\nqueen\\'s father, and that black bastard hopped up on the table and snatched a roast quail right out of \\nLord Tywin\\'s fingers. Robert laughed so hard he like to burst. You stay away from that one, child.\" \\nHe had run her halfway across the castle; twice around the Tower of the Hand, across the inner bailey, \\nthrough the stables, down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard and the barracks \\nof the gold cloaks, along the base of the river wall and up more steps and back and forth over Traitor\\'s \\nWalk, and then down again and through a gate and around a well and in and out of strange buildings until \\nArya didn\\'t know where she was. \\nPage 225\\n\\nNow at last she had him. High walls pressed close on either side, and ahead was a blank windowless \\nmass of stone. Quiet as a shadow, she repeated, sliding forward, light as a feather. \\nWhen she was three steps away from him, the tomcat bolted. Left, then right, he went; and right, then \\nleft, went Arya, cutting off his escape. He hissed again and tried to dart between her legs. Quick as a \\nsnake, she thought. Her hands closed around him. She hugged him to her chest, whirling and laughing \\naloud as his claws raked at the front of her leather jerkin. Ever so fast, she kissed him right between the \\neyes, and jerked her head back an instant before his claws would have found her face. The tomcat \\nyowled and spit. \\n\"What\\'s he doing to that cat?\" \\nStartled, Arya dropped the cat and whirled toward the voice. The torn bounded off in the blink of an \\neye. At the end of the alley stood a girl with a mass of golden curls, dressed as pretty as a doll in blue \\nsatin. Beside her was a plump little blond boy with a prancing stag sewn in pearls across the front of his \\ndoublet and a miniature sword at his belt. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen, Arya thought. A septa \\nas large as a draft horse hovered over them, and behind her two big men in crimson cloaks, Lannister \\nhouse guards. \\n\"What were you doing to that cat, boy?\" Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her brother she said, \"He\\'s a \\nragged boy, isn\\'t he? Look at him.\" She giggled. \\n\"A ragged dirty smelly boy,\" Tommen agreed. \\nThey don\\'t know me, Arya realized. They don\\'t even know I\\'m a girl. Small wonder; she was barefoot \\nand dirty, her hair tangled from the long run through the castle, clad in a jerkin ripped by cat claws and \\nbrown roughspun pants hacked off above her scabby knees. You don\\'t wear skirts and silks when you\\'re \\ncatching cats. Quickly she lowered her head and dropped to one knee. Maybe they wouldn\\'t recognize \\nher. If they did, she would never hear the end of it. Septa Mordane \\nwould be mortified, and Sansa would never speak to her again from the shame. \\nThe old fat septa moved forward. \"Boy, how did you come here? You have no business in this part of \\nthe castle.\" \\n\"You can\\'t keep this sort out,\" one of the red cloaks said. \"Like trying to keep out rats.\" \\n\"Who do you belong to, boy?\" the septa demanded. \"Answer me. What\\'s wrong with you, are you \\nmute?\" \\nArya\\'s voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella would know her for certain. \\n\"Godwyn, bring him here,\" the septa said. The taller of the guardsmen started down the alley. \\nPanic gripped her throat like a giant\\'s hand. Arya could not have spoken if her life had hung on it. Calm \\nas still water, she mouthed silently. \\nAs Godwyn reached for her, Arya moved. Quick as a snake. She leaned to her left, letting his fingers \\nbrush her arm, spinning around him, Smooth as summer silk. By the time he got himself turned, she was \\nPage 226\\n\\nsprinting down the alley. Swift as a deer. The septa was screeching at her. Arya slid between legs as \\nthick and white as marble columns, bounded to her feet, bowled into Prince Tommen and hopped over \\nhim when he sat down hard and said \"Oof, \" spun away from the second guard, and then she was past \\nthem all, running full out. \\nShe heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind her. She dropped and rolled. The red cloak \\nwent careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to her feet. She saw a window above her, high and \\nnarrow, scarcely more than an arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her \\nbreath as she wriggled through. Slippery as an eel. Dropping to the floor in front of a startled \\nscrubwoman, she hopped up, brushed the rushes off her clothes, and was off again, out the door and \\nalong a long hall, down a stair, across a hidden courtyard, around a corner and over a wall and through a \\nlow narrow window into a pitch-dark cellar. The sounds grew more and more distant behind her. \\nArya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they had recognized her, but \\nshe didn\\'t think they had. She\\'d moved too fast. Swift as a deer. \\nShe hunkered down in the dark against a damp stone wall and listened for the pursuit, but the only sound \\nwas the beating of her own heart and a distant drip of water. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself. She \\nwondered where she was. When they had first come to King\\'s Landing, she used to have bad dreams \\nabout getting lost in the castle. \\nFather said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her dreams it had been immense, an \\nendless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift and change behind her. She would find herself \\nwandering down gloomy halls past faded tapestries, descending endless circular stairs, darting through \\ncourtyards or over bridges, her shouts echoing unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone walls \\nwould seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. Sometimes she would hear her father\\'s \\nvoice, but always from a long way off, and no matter how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and \\nfainter, until it faded to nothing and Arya was alone in the dark. \\nIt was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight against her chest and shivered. \\nShe would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. By then it would be safe for her to come creeping \\nback out and find her way home. \\nBy the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as her eyes adjusted to the \\nblackness. Slowly the shapes around her took on form. Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through \\nthe gloom, and dimly she saw the jagged shadows of long teeth. She had lost the count. She closed her \\neyes and bit her lip and sent the fear away. When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. Would \\nnever have been. She pretended that Syrio was beside her in the dark, whispering in her ear. Calm as still \\nwater, she told herself. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. She opened her eyes again. \\nThe monsters were still there, but the fear was gone. \\nArya got to her feet, moving warily. The heads were all around her. She touched one, curious, \\nwondering if it was real. Her fingertips brushed a massive jaw. It felt real enough. The bone was smooth \\nbeneath her hand, cold and hard to the touch. She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a \\ndagger made of darkness. It made her shiver. \\n\"It\\'s dead,\" she said aloud. \"It\\'s just a skull, it can\\'t hurt me.\" Yet somehow the monster seemed to know \\nshe was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching her through the gloom, and there was something in \\nPage 227\\n\\nthat dim, cavernous room that did not love her. She edged away from the skull and backed into a \\nsecond, larger than the first. For an instant she could feel its teeth digging into her shoulder, as if it wanted \\na bite of her flesh. Arya whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang nipped at her jerkin, and then \\nshe was running. Another skull loomed ahead, the biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even slow. She \\nleapt over a ridge of black teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw herself against \\nthe door. \\nHer hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The door resisted a moment, \\nbefore it slowly began to swing \\ninward, with a creak so loud Arya was certain it could be heard all through the city. She opened the \\ndoor just far enough to slip through, into the hallway beyond. \\nIf the room with the monsters had been dark, the hall was the blackest pit in the seven hells. Calm as still \\nwater, Arya told herself, but even when she gave her eyes a moment to adjust, there was nothing to see \\nbut the vague grey outline of the door she had come through. She wiggled her fingers in front of her face, \\nfelt the air move, saw nothing. She was blind. A water dancer sees with all her senses, she reminded \\nherself. She closed her eyes and steadied her breathing one two three, drank in the quiet, reached out \\nwith her hands. \\nHer fingers brushed against rough unfinished stone to her left. She followed the wall, her hand skimming \\nalong the surface, taking small gliding steps through the darkness. All halls lead somewhere. \"ere there is \\na way in, there is a way out. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Arya would not be afraid. It seemed as if she \\nhad been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew past her cheek. \\nLoose hairs stirred faintly against her skin. \\nFrom somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the distant sound of voices. A \\nflickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she saw that she stood at the top of a great black \\nwell, a shaft twenty feet across plunging deep into the earth. Huge stones had been set into the curving \\nwalls as steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell them of. And \\nsomething was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of the earth . . . \\nArya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far below, she saw the light of a \\nsingle torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, she made out. Their shadows writhed against the \\nsides of the well, tall as giants. She could hear their voices, echoing up the shaft. \\n\"...found one bastard,\" one said. \"The rest will come soon. A day, two days, a fortnight . . .\" \\n\"And when he learns the truth, what will he do?\" a second voice asked in the liquid accents of the Free \\nCities. \\n\"The gods alone know,\" the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey smoke drifting up off the \\ntorch, writhing like a snake as it rose. \"The fools tried to kill his son, and what\\'s worse, they made a \\nmummer\\'s farce of it. He\\'s not a man to put that aside. I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each \\nother\\'s throats, whether we will it or no.\" \\n\"Too soon, too soon,\" the voice with the accent complained. \"What good is war now? We are not \\nready. Delay.\" \\nPage 228\\n\\n\"As well bid me stop time. Do you take me for a wizard?\" \\nThe other chuckled. \"No less.\" Flames licked at the cold air. The tall shadows were almost on top of \\nher. An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into her sight, his companion beside him. Arya \\ncrept back away from the well, dropped to her stomach, and flattened herself against the wall. She held \\nher breath as the men reached the top of the steps. \\n\"What would you have me do?\" asked the torchbearer, a stout man in a leather half cape. Even in heavy \\nboots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the ground. A round scarred face and a stubble of dark \\nbeard showed under his steel cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his \\nbelt. It seemed to Arya there was something oddly familiar about him. \\n\"If one Hand can die, why not a second?\" replied the man with the accent and the forked yellow beard. \\n\"You have danced the dance before, my friend.\" He was no one Arya had ever seen before, she was \\ncertain of it. Grossly fat, yet he seemed to walk lightly, carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a \\nwater dancer might. His rings glimmered in the torchlight, red-gold and pale silver, crusted with rubies, \\nsapphires, slitted yellow tiger eyes. Every finger wore a ring; some had two. \\n\"Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,\" the scarred man said as they stepped out into the \\nhall. Still as stone, Arya told herself, quiet as a shadow. Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, they did \\nnot see her pressed flat against the stone, only a few feet away. \\n\"Perhaps so,\" the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the long climb. \"Nonetheless, \\nwe must have time. The princess is with child. The khal will not bestir himself until his son is born. You \\nknow how they are, these savages.\" \\nThe man with the torch pushed at something. Arya heard a deep rumbling. A huge slab of rock, red in \\nthe torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a resounding crash that almost made her cry out. Where \\nthe entry to the well had been was nothing but stone, solid and unbroken. \\n\"If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,\" the stout man in the steel cap said. \"This is no \\nlonger a game for two players, if ever it was. Stannis Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my \\nreach, and the whispers say they are gathering swords around them. The Knight of Flowers writes \\nHighgarden, urging his lord father to send his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and \\nbeautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should bed her, wed her, and \\nmake a new queen. Littlefinger \\n... the gods only know what game Littlefinger is playing. Yet Lord Stark\\'s the one who troubles my \\nsleep. He has the bastard, he has the book, and soon enough he\\'ll have the truth. And now his wife has \\nabducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to Littlefinger\\'s meddling. Lord Tywin will take that for an outrage, \\nand Jaime has a queer affection for the Imp. If the Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as \\nwell. Delay, you say. Make haste, I reply. Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the \\nair forever.\" \\n\"You are more than a juggler, old friend. You are a true sorcerer. All I ask is that you work your magic \\nawhile longer.\" They started down the hall in the direction Arya had come, past the room with the \\nmonsters. \\nPage 229\\n\\n\"What I can do, I will,\" the one with the torch said softly. \"I must have gold, and another fifty birds.\" \\nShe let them get a long way ahead, then went creeping after them. Quiet as a shadow. \\n\"So many?\" The voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her. \"The ones you need are hard to \\nfind . . . so young, to know their letters . . . perhaps older . . . not die so easy . . .\" \\n\"No. The younger are safer . . . treat them gently if they kept their tongues the risk . . .\" \\nLong after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the torch, a smoking star that bid \\nher follow. Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept on straight, and both times she found herself at the \\ntop of steep, narrow stairs, the torch glimmering far below her. She hurried after it, down and down. \\nOnce she stumbled over a rock and fell against the wall, and her hand found raw earth supported by \\ntimbers, whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone. \\nShe must have crept after them for miles. Finally they were gone, but there was no place to go but \\nforward. She found the wall again and followed, blind and lost, pretending that Nymeria was padding \\nalong beside her in the darkness. At the end she was knee-deep in foulsmelling water, wishing she could \\ndance upon it as Syrio might have, and wondering if she\\'d ever see light again. It was full dark when \\nfinally Arya emerged into the night air. \\nShe found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into the river. She stank so badly \\nthat she stripped right there, dropping her soiled clothing on the riverbank as she dove into the deep \\nblack waters. She swam until she felt clean, and crawled out shivering. Some riders went past along the \\nriver road as Arya was \\nwashing her clothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her rags in the moonlight, they \\ntook no notice. \\nShe was miles from the castle, but from anywhere in King\\'s Landing you needed only to look up to see \\nthe Red Keep high on Aegon\\'s Hill, so there was no danger of losing her way. Her clothes were almost \\ndry by the time she reached the gatehouse. The portcullis was down and the gates barred, so she turned \\naside to a postern door. The gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when she told them to let her in. \\n\"Off with you,\" one said. \"The kitchen scraps are gone, and we\\'ll have no begging after dark.\" \\n:, I\\'m not a beggar,\" she said. \"I live here.\" \\n\\'I said, off with you. Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?\" \\n\"I want to see my father.\" \\nThe guards exchanged a glance. \"I want to fuck the queen myself, for all the good it does me,\" the \\nyounger one said. \\nThe older scowled. \"Who\\'s this father of yours, boy, the city ratcatcher?\" \\n\"The Hand of the King,\" Arya told him. \\nPage 230\\n\\nBoth men laughed, but then the older one swung his fist at her, casually, as a man would swat a dog. \\nArya saw the blow coming even before it began. She danced back out of the way, untouched. \"I\\'m not a \\nboy,\" she spat at them. \"I\\'m Arya Stark of Winterfell, and if you lay a hand on me my lord father will have \\nboth your heads on spikes. If you don\\'t believe me, fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the Tower of \\nthe Hand.\" She put her hands on her hips. \"Now are you going to open the gate, or do you need a clout \\non the ear to help your hearing?\" \\nHer father was alone in the solar when Harwin and Fat Tom marched her in, an oil lamp glowing softly at \\nhis elbow. He was bent over the biggest book Arya had ever seen, a great thick tome with cracked \\nyellow pages of crabbed script, bound between faded leather covers, but he closed it to listen to \\nHarwin\\'s report. His face was stern as he sent the men away with thanks. \\n\"You realize I had half my guard out searching for you?\" Eddard Stark said when they were alone. \\n\"Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear. She\\'s in the sept praying for your safe return. Arya, you \\nknow you are never to go beyond the castle gates without my leave.\" \\n\"I didn\\'t go out the gates,\" she blurted. \"Well, I didn\\'t mean to. I was down in the dungeons, only they \\nturned into this tunnel. It was all dark, and I didn\\'t have a torch or a candle to see by, so I had to follow. \\nI couldn\\'t go back the way I came on account of the monsters. Father, they were talking about killing \\nyou! Not the monsters, the two men. \\nThey didn\\'t see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a shadow, but I heard them. They said you \\nhad a book and a bastard and if one Hand could die, why not a second? Is that the book? Jon\\'s the \\nbastard, I bet.\" \\n\"Jon? Arya, what are you talking about? Who said this?\" \\n\"They did,\" she told him. \"There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow beard, and another in mail \\nand a steel cap, and the fat one said they had to delay but the other one told him he couldn\\'t keep \\njuggling and the wolf and the lion were going to eat each other and it was a mummer\\'s farce.\" She tried to \\nremember the rest. She hadn\\'t quite understood everything she\\'d heard, and now it was all mixed up in \\nher head. \"The fat one said the princess was with child. The one in the steel cap, he had the torch, he said \\nthat they had to hurry. I think he was a wizard.\" \\n\"A wizard,\" said Ned, unsmiling. \"Did he have a long white beard and tall pointed hat speckled with \\nstars?\" \\n\"No! It wasn\\'t like Old Nan\\'s stories. He didn\\'t look like a wizard, but the fat one said he was.\" \\n\"I warn you, Arya, if you\\'re spinning this thread of air-\" \\n\"No, I told you, it was in the dungeons, by the place with the secret wall. I was chasing cats, and well . . \\n.\" She screwed up her face. If she admitted knocking over Prince Tommen, he would be really angry \\nwith her. \". . . well, I went in this window. That\\'s where I found the monsters.\" \\n\"Monsters and wizards,\" her father said. \"It would seem you\\'ve had quite an adventure. These men you \\nheard, you say they spoke of juggling and mummery?\" \\n\"Yes,\" Arya admitted, \"only-\" \\nPage 231\\n\\n\"Arya, they were mummers,\" her father told her. \"There must be a dozen troupes in King\\'s Landing right \\nnow, come to make some coin off the tourney crowds. I\\'m not certain what these two were doing in the \\ncastle, but perhaps the king has asked for a show.\" \\n\"No.\" She shook her head stubbornly. \"They weren\\'t-\" \\n\"You shouldn\\'t be following people about and spying on them in any case. Nor do I cherish the notion of \\nmy daughter climbing in strange windows after stray cats. Look at you, sweetling. Your arms are covered \\nwith scratches. This has gone on long enough. Tell Syrio Forel that I want a word with hirn-\" \\nHe was interrupted by a short, sudden knock. \"Lord Eddard, pardons,\" Desmond called out, opening \\nthe door a crack, \"but there\\'s a black brother here begging audience. He says the matter is urgent. I \\nthought you would want to know.\" \\n\"My door is always open to the Night\\'s Watch,\" Father said. \\nDesmond ushered the man inside. He was stooped and ugly, with an unkempt beard and unwashed \\nclothes, yet Father greeted him pleasantly and asked his name. \\n\"Yoren, as it please m1ord. My pardons for the hour.\" He bowed to Arya. \"And this must be your son. \\nHe has your look.\" \\n\"I\\'m a girl,\" Arya said, exasperated. If the old man was down from the Wall, he must have come by way \\nof Winterfell. \"Do you know my brothers?\" she asked excitedly. \"Robb and Bran are at Winterfell, and \\nJon\\'s on the Wall. Jon Snow, he\\'s in the Night\\'s Watch too, you must know him, he has a direwolf, a \\nwhite one with red eyes. Is Jon a ranger yet? I\\'m Arya Stark.\" The old man in his smelly black clothes \\nwas looking at her oddly, but Arya could not seem to stop talking. \"When you ride back to the Wall, \\nwould you bring Jon a letter if I wrote one?\" She wished Jon were here right now. He\\'d believe her about \\nthe dungeons and the fat man with the forked beard and the wizard in the steel cap. \\n\"My daughter often forgets her courtesies,\" Eddard Stark said with a faint smile that softened his words. \\n\"I beg your forgiveness, Yoren. Did my brother Benjen send you?\" \\n\"No one sent me, m1ord, saving old Mormont. I\\'m here to find men for the Wall, and when Robert next \\nholds court, I\\'ll bend the knee and cry our need, see if the king and his Hand have some scum in the \\ndungeons they\\'d be well rid of. You might say as Benjen Stark is why we\\'re talking, though. His blood \\nran black. Made him my brother as much as yours. It\\'s for his sake I\\'m come. Rode hard, I did, near \\nkilled my horse the way I drove her, but I left the others well behind.\" \\n\"The others?\" \\nYoren spat. \"Sellswords and freeriders and like trash. That inn was full o\\' them, and I saw them take the \\nscent. The scent of blood or the scent of gold, they smell the same in the end. Not all o\\' them made for \\nKing\\'s Landing, either. Some went galloping for Casterly Rock, and the Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will \\nhave gotten the word by now, you can count on it.\" \\nFather frowned. \"What word is this?\" \\nPage 232\\n\\nYoren eyed Arya. \"One best spoken in private, m1ord, begging your pardons.\" \\n\"As you say. Desmond, see my daughter to her chambers.\" He kissed her on the brow. \"We\\'ll finish our \\ntalk on the morrow.\" \\nArya stood rooted to the spot. \"Nothing bad\\'s happened to Jon, has it?\" she asked Yoren. \"Or Uncle \\nBenjen?\" \\n\"Well, as to Stark, I can\\'t say. The Snow boy was well enough when I left the Wall. It\\'s not them as \\nconcerns me.\" \\nDesmond took her hand. \"Come along, milady. You heard your lord father.\" \\nArya had no choice but to go with him, wishing it had been Fat Tom. With Tom, she might have been \\nable to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what Yoren was saying, but Desmond was too \\nsingleminded to trick. \"How many guards does my father have?\" she asked him as they descended to her \\nbedchamber. \\n\"Here at King\\'s Landing? Fifty.\" \\n\"You wouldn\\'t let anyone kill him, would you?\" she asked. \\nDesmond laughed. \"No fear on that count, little lady. Lord Eddard\\'s guarded night and day. He\\'ll come \\nto no harm.\" \\n\"The Lannisters have more than fifty men,\" Arya pointed out. \\n\"So they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so you can sleep easy.\" \\n\"What if a wizard was sent to kill him?\" \\n\"Well, as to that,\" Desmond replied, drawing his longsword, \"wizards die the same as other men, once \\nyou cut their heads off.\" \\nEDDARD \\n\"Robert, I beg of you,\" Ned pleaded, \"hear what you are saying. You are talking of murdering a child.\" \\n\"The whore is pregnant!\" The king\\'s fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap. \"I \\nwarned you this would happen, Ned. Back in the barrowlands, I warned you, but you did not care to \\nhear it. Well, you\\'ll hear it now. I want them dead, mother and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is \\nthat plain enough for you? I want them dead.\" \\nThe other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were somewhere else. No doubt they \\nwere wiser than he was. Eddard Stark had seldom felt quite so alone. \"You will dishonor yourself forever \\nif you do this.\" \\nPage 233\\n\\n\"Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I cannot see the shadow of the \\naxe when it is hanging over my own neck.\" \\n\"There is no axe,\" Ned told his king. \"Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty years removed . . . if it \\nexists at all.\" \\n\"If?\" Varys asked softly, wringing powdered hands together. \"My lord, you wrong me. Would I bring \\nties to king and council?\" \\nNed looked at the eunuch coldly. \"You would bring us the whisperings of a traitor half a world away, my \\nlord. Perhaps Mormont is wrong. Perhaps he is lying.\" \\n\"Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me,\" Varys said with a sly smile. \"Rely on it, my lord. The princess is \\nwith child.\" \\n\"So you say. If you are wrong, we need not fear. If the girl miscarries, we need not fear. If she births a \\ndaughter in place of a son, we need not fear. If the babe dies in infancy, we need not fear.\" \\n\"But if it is a boy?\" Robert insisted. \"If he lives?\" \\n\"The narrow sea would still lie between us. I shall fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run \\non water.\" \\nThe king took a swallow of wine and glowered at Ned across the council table. \"So you would counsel \\nme to do nothing until the dragonspawn has landed his army on my shores, is that it?\" \\n\"This \\'dragonspawn\\' is in his mother\\'s belly,\" Ned said. \"Even Aegon did no conquering until after he was \\nweaned.\" \\n\"Gods! You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark.\" The king looked around the council table. \"Have the \\nrest of you mislaid your tongues? Will no one talk sense to this frozen-faced fool?\" \\nVarys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned\\'s sleeve. \"I understand your qualms, \\nLord Eddard, truly I do. It gave me no joy to bring this grievous news to council. It is a terrible thing we \\ncontemplate, a vile thing. Yet we who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, \\nhowevermuch it pains us.\" \\nLord Renly shrugged. \"The matter seems simple enough to me. We ought to have had Viserys and his \\nsister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the mistake of listening to Jon Arryn.\" \\n\"Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,\" Ned replied. \"On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a \\ndozen good men, Robert\\'s friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near \\ndeath, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but your brother said, \\'I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor \\nfor fighting well,\\' and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan\\'s wounds.\" He gave the king a long cool \\nlook. \"Would that man were here today.\" \\nRobert had shame enough to blush. \"It was not the same,\" he complained. \"Ser Barristan was a knight of \\nthe Kingsguard.\" \\nPage 234\\n\\n\"Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl.\" Ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of \\nwisdom, yet he could not keep silent. \"Robert, I ask you, what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if \\nnot to put an end to the murder of children?\" \\n\"To put an end to Targaryens!\" the king growled. \\n\"Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar.\" Ned fought to keep the scorn out of his voice, and \\nfailed. \"Have the years so unmanned you that you tremble at the shadow of an unborn child?\" \\nRobert purpled. \"No more, Ned,\" he warned, pointing. \"Not another word. Have you forgotten who is \\nking here?\" \\n\"No, Your Grace,\" Ned replied. \"Have you?\" \\n\"Enough!\" the king bellowed. \"I am sick of talk. I\\'ll be done with this, or be damned. What say you all?\" \\n\"She must be killed,\" Lord Renly declared. \\n\"We have no choice,\" murmured Varys. \"Sadly, sadly \\nSer Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said, \"Your Grace, there is honor in \\nfacing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him in his mother\\'s womb. Forgive me, but I must \\nstand with Lord Eddard.\" \\nGrand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat, a process that seemed to take some minutes. \"My order \\nserves the realm, not the ruler. Once I counseled King Aerys as loyally as I counsel King Robert now, so \\nI bear this girl child of his no ill will. Yet I ask you this-should war come again, how many soldiers will \\ndie? How many towns will burn? How many children will be ripped from their mothers to perish on the \\nend of a spear?\" He stroked his luxuriant white beard, infinitely sad, infinitely weary. \"Is it not wiser, even \\nkinder, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that tens of thousands might live?\" \\n\"Kinder,\" Varys said. \"Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester. It is so true. Should the gods in their \\ncaprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must bleed.\" \\nLittlefinger was the last. As Ned looked to him, Lord Petyr stifled a yawn. \"When you find yourself in \\nbed with an ugly woman, the best thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it,\" he declared. \"Waiting \\nwon\\'t make the maid any prettier. Kiss her and be done with it.\" \\n\"Kiss her?\" Ser Barristan repeated, aghast. \\n\"A steel kiss,\" said Littlefinger. \\nRobert turned to face his Hand. \"Well, there it is, Ned. You and Selmy stand alone on this matter. The \\nonly question that remains is, who can we find to kill her?\" \\n\"Mormont craves a royal pardon,\" Lord Renly reminded them. \\n\"Desperately,\" Varys said, \"yet he craves life even more. By now, the princess nears Vaes Dothrak, \\nwhere it is death to draw a blade. If I told you what the Dothraki would do to the poor man who used \\nPage 235\\n\\none on a khaleesi, none of you would sleep tonight.\" He stroked a powdered cheek. \"Now, poison . . . \\nthe tears of Lys, let us say. Khal Drogo need never know it was not a natural death.\" \\nGrand Maester Pycelle\\'s sleepy eyes flicked open. He squinted suspiciously at the eunuch. \\n\"Poison is a coward\\'s weapon,\" the king complained. \\nNed had heard enough. \"You send hired knives to kill a fourteenyear-old girl and still quibble about \\nhonor?\" He pushed back his chair and stood. \"Do it yourself, Robert. The man who passes the sentence \\nshould swing the sword. Look her in the eyes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You \\nowe her that much at least.\" \\n\"Gods,\" the king swore, the word exploding out of him as if he could barely contain his fury. \"You mean \\nit, damn you.\" He reached for the flagon of wine at his elbow, found it empty, and flung it away to shatter \\nagainst the wall. \"I am out of wine and out of patience. Enough of this. Just have it done.\" \\n\"I will not be part of murder, Robert. Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix my seal to it.\" \\nFor a moment Robert did not seem to understand what Ned was saying. Defiance was not a dish he \\ntasted often. Slowly his face changed as comprehension came. His eyes narrowed and a flush crept up \\nhis neck past the velvet collar. He pointed an angry finger at Ned. \"You are the King\\'s Hand, Lord Stark. \\nYou will do as I command you, or I\\'ll find me a Hand who will.\" \\n\"I wish him every success.\" Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at the folds of his cloak, the \\nornate silver hand that was his badge of office. He laid it on the table in front of the king, saddened by the \\nmemory of the man who had pinned it on him, the friend he had loved. \"I thought you a better man than \\nthis, Robert. I thought we had made a nobler king.\" \\nRobert\\'s face was purple. \"Out, \" he croaked, choking on his rage. \"Out, damn you, I\\'m done with you. \\nWhat are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And make certain I never look on your face again, \\nor I swear, I\\'ll have your head on a spike!\" \\nNed bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel Robert\\'s eyes on his back. As \\nhe strode from the council chambers, the discussion resumed with scarcely a pause. \"On Braavos there is \\na society called the Faceless Men,\" Grand Maester Pycelle offered. \\n\"Do you have any idea how costly they are?\" Littlefinger complained. \"You could hire an army of \\ncommon sellswords for half the price, and that\\'s for a merchant. I don\\'t dare think what they might ask \\nfor a princess.\" \\nThe closing of the door behind him silenced the voices. Ser Boros Blount was stationed outside the \\nchamber, wearing the long white cloak and armor of the Kingsguard. He gave Ned a quick, curious \\nglance from the corner of his eye, but asked no questions. \\nThe day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower of the Hand. He could \\nfeel the threat of rain in the air. Ned \\nPage 236\\n\\nwould have welcomed it. It might have made him feel a trifle less unclean. When he reached his solar, he \\nsummoned Vayon Poole. The steward came at once. \"You sent for me, my lord Hand?\" \\n\"Hand no longer,\" Ned told him. \"The king and I have quarreled. We shall be returning to Winterfell.\" \\n\"I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord. We will need a fortnight to ready everything for the \\njourney.\" \\n\"We may not have a fortnight. We may not have a day. The king mentioned something about seeing my \\nhead on a spike.\" Ned frowned. He did not truly believe the king would harm him, not Robert. He was \\nangry now, but once Ned was safely out of sight, his rage would cool as it always did. \\nAlways? Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar Targaryen. Fifteen years dead, \\nyet Robert hates him as much as ever. It was a disturbing notion . . . and there was the other matter, the \\nbusiness with Catelyn and the dwarf that Yoren had warned him of last night. That would come to light \\nsoon, as sure as sunrise, and with the king in such a black fury . . . Robert might not care a fig for Tyrion \\nLannister, but it would touch on his pride, and there was no telling what the queen might do. \\n\"It might be safest if I went on ahead,\" he told Poole. \"I will take my daughters and a few guardsmen. \\nThe rest of you can follow when you are ready. Inform Jory, but tell no one else, and do nothing until the \\ngirls and I have gone. The castle is full of eyes and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known.\" \\n\"As you command, my lord.\" \\nWhen he had gone, Eddard Stark went to the window and sat brooding. Robert had left him no choice \\nthat he could see. He ought to thank him. It would be good to return to Winterfell. He ought never have \\nleft. His sons were waiting there. Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a new son together when he \\nreturned, they were not so old yet. And of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of the deep \\nquiet of the wolfswood at night. \\nAnd yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still undone. Robert and his council of \\ncravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if left unchecked . . . or, worse, sell it to the Lannisters in \\npayment of their loans. And the truth of Jon Arryn\\'s death still eluded him. Oh, he had found a few \\npieces, enough to convince him that Jon had indeed been murdered, but that was no more than the spoor \\nof an animal on the forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself yet, though he sensed it was there, \\nlurking, hidden, treacherous. \\nIt struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. \\nNed was no sailor, and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if he took ship he could stop \\nat Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a raven off across the water, with a \\npolite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to return to his seat on the small council. As yet, there had \\nbeen no reply, but the silence only deepened his suspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn \\nhad died for, he was certain of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the ancient \\nisland fortress of House Targaryen. \\nAnd when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous \\nto share, even with those you love and trust. Ned slid the dagger that Catelyn had brought him out of the \\nsheath on his belt. The Imp\\'s knife. Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. \\nPage 237\\n\\nAnother secret, or only a different strand of the same web? \\nCould Robert be part of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would not have thought Robert \\ncould command the murder of women and children either. Catelyn had tried to warn him. You knew the \\nman, she had said. The king is a stranger to you. The sooner he was quit of King\\'s Landing, the better. If \\nthere was a ship sailing north on the morrow, it would be well to be on it. \\nHe summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make inquiries, quietly but quickly. \"Find \\nme a fast ship with a skilled captain,\" he told the steward. \"I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the \\nquality of its appointments, so long as it is swift and safe. I wish to leave at once.\" \\nPoole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor. \"Lord Baelish to see you, \\nm\\'lord.\" \\nNed was half-tempted to turn him away, but thought better of it. He was not free yet; until he was, he \\nmust play their games. \"Show him in, Tom.\" \\nLord Petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning. He wore a slashed velvet \\ndoublet in cream-and-silver, a grey silk cloak trimmed with black fox, and his customary mocking smile. \\nNed greeted him coldly. \"Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?\" \\n\"I won\\'t detain you long, I\\'m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda. Lamprey pie and roast suckling pig. \\nShe has some thought to wed me to her younger daughter, so her table is always astonishing. If truth be \\ntold, I\\'d sooner marry the pig, but don\\'t tell her. I do love lamprey pie.\" \\n\"Don\\'t let me keep you from your eels, my lord,\" Ned said with icy disdain. \"At the moment, I cannot \\nthink of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.\" \\n\"Oh, I\\'m certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few names. Varys, say. Cersei. Or \\nRobert. His Grace is most wroth with you. He went on about you at some length after you took your \\nleave of us this morning. The words insolence and ingratitude came into it frequently, I seem to recall.\" \\nNed did not honor that with a reply. Nor did he offer his guest a seat, but Littlefinger took one anyway. \\n\"After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire the Faceless Men,\" he continued \\nblithely. \"Instead Varys will quietly let it be known that we\\'ll make a lord of whoever does in the \\nTargaryen girl.\" \\nNed was disgusted. \"So now we grant titles to assassins.\" \\nLittlefinger shrugged. \"Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are expensive. If truth be told, I did the \\nTargaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of honor. Let some sellsword drunk on visions of \\nlordship try to kill her. Likely he\\'ll make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If \\nwe\\'d sent a Faceless Man after her, she\\'d be as good as buried.\" \\nNed frowned. \"You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and now you expect me to \\nbelieve that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do you take me for?\" \\n\"Well, quite an enormous one, actually,\" said Littlefinger, laughing. \\nPage 238\\n\\n\"Do you always find murder so amusing, Lord Baelish?\" \\n\"It\\'s not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, it\\'s you. You rule like a man dancing on rotten ice. I daresay \\nyou will make a noble splash. I believe I heard the first crack this morning.\" \\n\"The first and last,\" said Ned. \"I\\'ve had my fill.\" \\n\"When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?\" \\n\"As soon as I can. What concern is that of yours?\" \\n\"None . . . but if perchance you\\'re still here come evenfall, I\\'d be pleased to take you to this brothel your \\nman Jory has been searching for so ineffectually.\" Littlefinger smiled. \"And I won\\'t even tell the Lady \\nCatelyn.\" \\nCATELYN \\n\"My lady, you should have sent word of your coming,\" Ser Donnel Waynwood told her as their horses \\nclimbed the pass. \"We would have sent an escort. The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a party \\nas small as yours.\" \\n\"We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel,\" Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt as though her heart had \\nturned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, and she could not even find it in her to weep \\nfor them. Even their names were fading. \"The clansmen harried us day and night. We lost three men in the \\nfirst attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister\\'s serving man died of a fever when his wounds \\nfestered. When we heard your men approaching, I thought us doomed for certain.\" They had drawn up \\nfor a last desperate fight, blades in hand and backs to the rock. The dwarf had been whetting the edge of \\nhis axe and making some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them, the \\nmoon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky-blue and white. Catelyn had never seen a more welcome sight. \\n\"The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,\" Ser Donnel said. He was a stocky youth of twenty \\nyears, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock of thick brown hair. \"If it were up to me, I \\nwould take a hundred men into the mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some \\nsharp lessons, but your sister has \\nforbidden it. She would not even permit her knights to fight in the Hand\\'s tourney. She wants all our \\nswords kept close to home, to defend the Vale . . . against what, no one is certain. Shadows, some say.\" \\nHe looked at her anxiously, as if he had suddenly remembered who she was. \"I hope I have not spoken \\nout of turn, my lady. I meant no offense.\" \\n\"Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.\" Catelyn knew what her sister feared. Not shadows, \\nLannisters, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the dwarf rode beside Bronn. The two of them \\nhad grown thick as thieves since Chiggen had died. The little man was more cunning than she liked. \\nWhen they had entered the mountains, he had been her captive, bound and helpless. What was he now? \\nHer captive still, yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe strapped to his saddle, wearing \\nthe shadowskin cloak he\\'d won dicing with the singer and the chainmail hauberk he\\'d taken off Chiggen\\'s \\nPage 239\\n\\ncorpse. Two score men flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in \\nservice to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn\\'s young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no hint of fear. Could I be \\nwrong? Catelyn wondered, not for the first time. Could he be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn \\nand all the rest? And if he was, what did that make her? Six men had died to bring him here. \\nResolute, she pushed her doubts away. \"When we reach your keep, I would take it kindly if you could \\nsend for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish from his wounds.\" More than once she had \\nfeared the gallant old knight would not survive the journey. Toward the end he could scarcely sit his \\nhorse, and Bronn had urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied \\nhim in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch over him. \\nSer Donnel hesitated before he answered. \"The Lady Lysa has commanded the maester to remain at the \\nEyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,\" he said. \"We have a septon at the gate who tends to our \\nwounded. He can see to your man\\'s hurts.\" \\nCatelyn had more faith in a maester\\'s learning than a septon\\'s prayers. She was about to say as much \\nwhen she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built into the very stone of the mountains on either \\nside of them. Where the pass shrank to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast, \\ntwin watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered grey stone that \\narched above the road. Silent faces watched from arrow slits in tower, battlements, and bridge. When \\nthey had climbed almost to the top, a knight rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were \\ngrey, but his cloak was the rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and \\nobsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. \"Who would pass the Bloody Gate?\" he called. \\n\"Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,\" the young knight answered. \\nThe Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. \"I thought the lady looked familiar. You are far from home, little \\nCat.\" \\n\"And you, Uncle,\" she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing that hoarse, smoky voice \\nagain took her back twenty years, to the days of her childhood. \\n\"My home is at my back,\" he said gruffly. \\n\"Your home is in my heart,\" Catelyn told him. \"Take off your helm. I would look on your face again.\" \\n\"The years have not improved it, I fear,\" Brynden Tully said, but when he lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw \\nthat he lied. His features were lined and weathered, and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left \\nhim only grey, but the smile was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in \\nhis deep blue eyes. \"Did Lysa know you were coming?\" \\n\"There was no time to send word ahead,\" Catelyn told him. The others were coming up behind her. \"I \\nfear we ride before the storm, Uncle.\" \\n\"May we enter the Vale?\" Ser Donnel asked. The Waynwoods were ever ones for ceremony. \\n\"In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True Warden of the East, I bid \\nyou enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,\" Ser Brynden replied. \"Come.\" \\nPage 240\\n\\nAnd so she rode behind him, beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a dozen armies had dashed \\nthemselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes. On the far side of the stoneworks, the mountains opened up \\nsuddenly upon a vista of green fields, blue sky, and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. \\nThe Vale of Arryn bathed in the morning light. \\nIt stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and \\nhundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the sun, protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks. \\nWheat and corn and barley grew high in its fields, and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger \\nnor the fruit any sweeter than here. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high road \\ncrested the last pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two miles below. The Vale was \\nnarrow here, no more than a half day\\'s ride across, and the northern mountains seemed so close that \\nCatelyn could almost reach out and touch them. Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the \\nGiant\\'s Lance, a mountain that even mountains looked up to, its head lost in icy mists three and a half \\nmiles above the valley floor. Over its massive western shoulder flowed the ghost torrent of Alyssa\\'s \\nTears. Even from this distance, Catelyn could make out the shining silver thread, bright against the dark \\nstone. \\nWhen her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and pointed. \"It\\'s there, beside \\nAlyssa\\'s Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of white every now and then, if you look hard and the \\nsun hits the walls just right.\" \\nSeven towers, Ned had told her, like white daggers thrust into the belly of the sky, so high you can stand \\non the parapets and look down on the clouds. \"How long a ride?\" she asked. \\n\"We can be at the mountain by evenfall,\" Uncle Brynden said, \"but the climb will take another day.\" \\nSer Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind. \"My lady,\" he said, \"I fear I can go no farther today.\" His face \\nsagged beneath his ragged, newgrown whiskers, and he looked so weary Catelyn feared he might fall off \\nhis horse. \\n\"Nor should you,\" she said. \"You have done all I could have asked of you, and a hundred times more. \\nMy uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie. Lannister must come with me, but there is no \\nreason that you and the others should not rest here and recover your strength.\" \\n\"We should be honored to have them to guest,\" Ser Donnel said with the grave courtesy of the young. \\nBeside Ser Rodrik, only Bronn, Ser Willis Wode, and Marillion the singer remained of the party that had \\nridden with her from the inn by the crossroads. \\n\"My lady,\" Marillion said, riding forward. \"I beg you allow me to accompany you to the Eyrie, to see the \\nend of the tale as I saw its beginnings.\" The boy sounded haggard, yet strangely determined; he had a \\nfevered shine to his eyes. \\nCatelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice he had made himself, and how he had \\ncome to survive the journey when so many braver men lay dead and unburied behind them, she could \\nnever say. Yet here he was, with a scruff of beard that made him look almost a man. Perhaps she owed \\nhim something for having come this far. \"Very well,\" she told him. \\nPage 241\\n\\n\"I\\'ll come as well,\" Bronn announced. \\nShe liked that less well. Without Bronn she would never have reached the Vale, she knew; the sellsword \\nwas as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his sword had helped cut them through to safety. \\nYet for all that, Catelyn misliked the man. Courage he had, and strength, but there was no kindness in \\nhim, and little loyalty. And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low voices \\nand laughing at some private joke. She would have preferred to separate him from the dwarf here and \\nnow, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to the Eyrie, she could see no gracious way to deny \\nthat same right to Bronn. \"As you wish,\" she said, although she noted that he had not actually asked her \\npermission. \\nSer Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over their wounds. Their \\nhorses were left behind as well, poor ragged things. Ser Donnel promised to send birds ahead to the \\nEyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word of their coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from \\nthe stables, surefooted mountain stock with shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again. \\nCatelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor. Behind came Bronn, Tyrion \\nLannister, Marillion, and six of Brynden\\'s men. \\nNot until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of earshot of the others, did \\nBrynden Tully turn to her and say, \"So, child. Tell me about this storm of yours.\" \\n\"I have not been a child in many years, Uncle,\" Catelyn said, but she told him nonetheless. It took longer \\nthan she would have believed to tell it all, Lysa\\'s letter and Bran\\'s fall, the assassin\\'s dagger and \\nLittlefinger and her chance meeting with Tyrion Lannister in the crossroadsinn. \\nHer uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew deeper. Brynden Tully \\nhad always known how to listen . . . to anyone but her father. He was Lord Hoster\\'s brother, younger by \\nfive years, but the two of them had been at war as far back as Catelyn could remember. During one of \\ntheir louder quarrels, when Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden \"the black goat of the \\nTully flock.\" Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a leaping trout, so he \\nought to be a black fish rather than a black goat, and from that day forward he had taken it as his \\npersonal emblem. \\nThe war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at their wedding feast that \\nBrynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve Lysa and her new husband, the Lord of the \\nEyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his brother\\'s name since, from what Edmure told her in his infrequent \\nletters. \\nNonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn\\'s girlhood, it had been Brynden the Blackfish to whom \\nLord Hoster\\'s children had run \\nwith their tears and their tales, when Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure . . . \\nand yes, even Petyr Baelish, their father\\'s ward . . . he had listened to them all patiently, as he listened \\nnow, laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish misfortunes. \\nWhen she was done, her uncle remained silent for a long time, as his horse negotiated the steep, rocky \\nPage 242\\n\\ntrail. \"Your father must be told,\" he said at last. \"If the Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and \\nthe Vale walled up behind its mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path.\" \\n\"I\\'d had the same fear,\" Catelyn admitted. \"I shall ask Maester Colemon to send a bird when we reach \\nthe Eyrie.\" She had other messages to send as well; the commands that Ned had given her for his \\nbannermen, to ready the defenses of the north. \"What is the mood in the Vale?\" she asked. \\n\"Angry,\" Brynden Tully admitted. \"Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult was keenly felt when the \\nking named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had held for near three hundred years. Lysa has \\ncommanded us to call her son the True Warden of the East, but no one is fooled. Nor is your sister alone \\nin wondering at the manner of the Hand\\'s death. None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but \\nsuspicion casts a long shadow.\" He gave Catelyn a look, his mouth tight. \"And there is the boy.\" \\n\"The boy? What of him?\" She ducked her head as they passed under a low overhang of rock, and \\naround a sharp turn. \\nHer uncle\\'s voice was troubled. \"Lord Robert,\" he sighed. \"Six years old, sickly, and prone to weep if \\nyou take his dolls away. Jon Arryn\\'s trueborn heir, by all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too \\nweak to sit his father\\'s seat, Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord \\nJon served in King\\'s Landing, and many whisper that he should rule until the boy comes of age. Others \\nbelieve that Lysa must marry again, and soon. Already the suitors gather like crows on a battlefield. The \\nEyrie is full of them.\" \\n\"I might have expected that,\" Catelyn said. Small wonder there; Lysa was still young, and the kingdom of \\nMountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift. \"Will Lysa take another husband?\" \\n\"She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,\" Brynden Tully said, \"but she has already \\nrejected Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men. She swears that this time she will choose her lord \\nhusband.\" \\n\"You of all people can scarce fault her for that.\" \\nSer Brynden snorted. \"Nor do 1, but . . . it seems to me Lysa is \\nonly playing at courtship. She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until her \\nboy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.\" \\n\"A woman can rule as wisely as a man,\" Catelyn said. \\n\"The tight woman can,\" her uncle said with a sideways glance. \"Make no mistake, Cat. Lysa is not you.\" \\nHe hesitated a moment. \"If truth be told, I fear you may not find your sister as helpful as you would like.\" \\nShe was puzzled. \"What do you mean?\" \\n\"The Lysa who came back from King\\'s Landing is not the same girl who went south when her husband \\nwas named Hand. Those years were hard for her. You must know. Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, \\nbut their marriage was made from politics, not passion.\" \\n\"As was my own.\" \\nPage 243\\n\\n\"They began the same, but your ending has been happier than your sister\\'s. Two babes stillborn, twice as \\nmany miscarriages, Lord Arryn\\'s death . . . Catelyn, the gods gave Lysa only the one child, and he is all \\nyour sister lives for now, poor boy. Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the \\nLannisters. Your sister is afraid, child, and the Lannisters are what she fears most. She ran to the Vale, \\nstealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night, and all to snatch her son out of the lion\\'s mouth . \\n. . and now you have brought the lion to her door.\" \\n\"In chains,\" Catelyn said. A crevasse yawned on her right, falling away into darkness. She reined up her \\nhorse and picked her way along step by careful step. \\n\"Oh?\" Her uncle glanced back, to where Tyrion Lannister was making his slow descent behind them. \"I \\nsee an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow. \\nWhere are the chains, sweet one?\" \\nCatelyn shifted uneasily in her seat. \"The dwarf is here, and not by choice. Chains or no, he is my \\nprisoner. Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less than 1. It was her own lord husband the \\nLannisters murdered, and her own letter that first warned us against them.\" \\nBrynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile. \"I hope you are right, child,\" he sighed, in tones that said she \\nwas wrong. \\nThe sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the hooves of their horses. \\nThe road widened and grew straight, and for the first time Catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses \\ngrowing. Once they reached the valley floor, the going was faster and they made good time, cantering \\nthrough verdant greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets, past orchards and golden wheat fields, splashing \\n324 GEORGL R.R. MARTIN \\nacross a dozen sunlit streams. Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of them, a double banner flying \\nfrom his staff; the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn on high, and below it his own black fish. Farm \\nwagons and merchants\\' carts and riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass. \\nEven so, it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the foot of the Giant\\'s Lance. \\nTorches flickered atop its ramparts, and the horned moon danced upon the dark waters of its moat. The \\ndrawbridge was up and the portcullis down, but Catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse and spilling \\nfrom the windows of the square towers beyond. \\n\"The Gates of the Moon,\" her uncle said as the party drew rein. His standard-bearer rode to the edge of \\nthe moat to hail the men in the gatehouse. \"Lord Nestor\\'s seat. He should be expecting us. Look up.\" \\nCatelyn raised her eyes, up and up and up. At first all she saw was stone and trees, the looming mass of \\nthe great mountain shrouded in night, as black as a starless sky. Then she noticed the glow of distant fires \\nwell above them; a tower keep, built upon the steep side of the mountain, its lights like orange eyes \\nstaring down from above. Above that was another, higher and more distant, and still higher a third, no \\nmore than a flickering spark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons soared, a flash of white in the \\nmoonlight. Vertigo washed over her as she stared upward at the pale towers, so far above. \\n\"The Eyrie,\" she heard Marillion murmur, awed. \\nThe sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in. \"The Arryns must not be overfond of company. If you\\'re \\nPage 244\\n\\nplanning to make us climb that mountain in the dark, I\\'d rather you kill me here.\" \\n\"We\\'ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,\" Brynden told him. \\n\"I can scarcely wait,\" the dwarf replied. \"How do we get up there? I\\'ve no experience at riding goats.\" \\n\"Mules,\" Brynden said, smiling. \\n\"There are steps carved into the mountain,\" Catelyn said. Ned had told her about them when he talked \\nof his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn. \\nHer uncle nodded. \"It is too dark to see them, but the steps are there. Too steep and narrow for horses, \\nbut mules can manage them most of the way. The path is guarded by three waycastles, Stone and Snow \\nand Sky. The mules will take us as far up as Sky.\" \\nTyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully. \"And beyond that?\" \\nBrynden smiled. \"Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We ascend on foot the rest of the \\nway. Or perchance you\\'d prefer to \\nride a basket. The Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great winches \\nwith long iron chains to draw supplies up from below. If you prefer, my lord of Lannister, I can arrange \\nfor you to ride up with the bread and beer and apples.\" \\nThe dwarf gave a bark of laughter. \"Would that I were a pumpkin,\" he said. \"Alas, my lord father would \\nno doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister went to his fate like a load of turnips. If you ascend on \\nfoot, I fear I must do the same. We Lannisters do have a certain pride.\" \\n\"Pride?\" Catelyn snapped. His mocking tone and easy manner made her angry. \"Arrogance, some might \\ncall it. Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.\" \\n\"My brother is undoubtedly arrogant,\" Tyrion Lannister replied. \"My father is the soul of avarice, and my \\nsweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking breath. 1, however, am innocent as a little lamb. \\nShall I bleat for you?\" He grinned. \\nThe drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply, and they heard the sound of oiled chains \\nas the portcullis was drawn up. Men-at-arms carried burning brands out to light their way, and her uncle \\nled them across the moat. Lord Nestor Royce, High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the \\nMoon, was waiting in the yard to greet them, surrounded by his knights. \"Lady Stark,\" he said, bowing. \\nHe was a massive, barrel-chested man, and his bow was clumsy. \\nCatelyn dismounted to stand before him. \"Lord Nestor,\" she said. She knew the man only by reputation; \\nBronze Yohn\\'s cousin, from a lesser branch of House Royce, yet still a formidable lord in his own right. \\n\"We have had a long and tiring journey. I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.\" \\n\"My roof is yours, my lady,\" Lord Nestor returned gruffly, \"but your sister the Lady Lysa has sent down \\nword from the Eyrie. She wishes to see you at once. The rest of your party will be housed here and sent \\nup at first light.\" \\nPage 245\\n\\nHer uncle swung off his horse. \"What madness is this?\" he said bluntly. Brynden Tully had never been a \\nman to blunt the edge of his words. \"A night ascent, with the moon not even full? Even Lysa should know \\nthat\\'s an invitation to a broken neck.\" \\n\"The mules know the way, Ser Brynden.\" A wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen years stepped up beside \\nLord Nestor. Her dark hair was cropped short and straight around her head, and she wore riding \\nleathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail. She bowed to Catelyn, more gracefully than her lord. \"I \\npromise you, my lady, no harm will \\ncome to you. It would be my honor to take you up. I\\'ve made the dark climb a hundred times. Mychel \\nsays my father must have been a goat.\" \\nShe sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile. \"Do you have a name, child?\" \\n\"Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,\" the girl said. \\nIt did not please her; it was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face. Stone was a bastard\\'s \\nname in the Vale, as Snow was in the north, and Flowers in Highgarden; in each of the Seven Kingdoms, \\ncustom had fashioned a surname for children born with no names of their own. Catelyn had nothing \\nagainst this girl, but suddenly she could not help but think of Ned\\'s bastard on the Wall, and the thought \\nmade her angry and guilty, both at once. She struggled to find words for a reply. \\nLord Nestor filled the silence. \"Mya\\'s a clever girl, and if she vows she will bring you safely to the Lady \\nLysa, I believe her. She has not failed me yet.\" \\n\"Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,\" Catelyn said. \"Lord Nestor, I charge you to keep a close \\nguard on my prisoner.\" \\n\"And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped capon, before he dies of \\nhunger,\" Lannister said. \"A girl would be pleasant as well, but I suppose that\\'s too much to ask of you.\" \\nThe sellsword Bronn laughed aloud. \\nLord Nestor ignored the banter. \"As you say, my lady, so it will be done.\" Only then did he look at the \\ndwarf. \"See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and bring him meat and mead.\" \\nCatelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led off, then followed the \\nbastard girl through the castle. Two mules were waiting in the upper bailey, saddled and ready. Mya \\nhelped her mount one while a guardsman in a sky-blue cloak opened the narrow postern gate. Beyond \\nwas dense forest of pine and spruce, and the mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there, \\nchiseled deep into the rock, ascending into the sky. \"Some people find it easier if they close their eyes,\" \\nMya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. \"When they get frightened or dizzy, \\nsometimes they hold on to the mule too tight. They don\\'t like that.\" \\n\"I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,\" Catelyn said. \"I do not frighten easily. Do you plan to light a \\ntorch?\" The steps were black as pitch. \\nThe girl made a face. \"Torches just blind you. On a clear night like this, the moon and the stars are \\nenough. Mychel says I have the eyes of the owl.\" She mounted and urged her mule up the first step. \\nCatelyn\\'s animal followed of its own accord. \\nPage 246\\n\\nA GAN4E OF THRONES 327 \\n\"You mentioned Mychel before,\" Catelyn said. The mules set the pace, slow but steady. She was \\nperfectly content with that. \\n\"Mychel\\'s my love,\" Mya explained. \"Mychel Redfort. He\\'s squire to Ser Lyn Corbray. We\\'re to wed as \\nsoon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.\" \\nShe sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn smiled, but the smile was \\ntinged with sadness. The Redforts were an old name in the Vale, she knew, with the blood of the First \\nMen in their veins. His love she might be, but no Redfort would ever wed a bastard. His family would \\narrange a more suitable match for him, to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a daughter \\nof some greater house outside the Vale. If Mychel Redfort laid with this girl at all, it would be on the \\nwrong side of the sheet. \\nThe ascent was easier than Catelyn had dared hope. The trees pressed close, leaning over the path to \\nmake a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so it seemed as though they were moving up a \\nlong black tunnel. But the mules were surefooted and tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed \\nwith night-eyes. They plodded upward, winding their way back and forth across the face of the mountain \\nas the steps twisted and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted the path, so the shoes of their \\nmules made only the softest sound on the rock. The quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking motion set \\nCatelyn to swaying in her saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep. \\nPerhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate was looming before them. \\n\"Stone,\" Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone \\nwalls, and two fat round towers overtopped the keep. The gate swung open at Mya\\'s shout. Inside, the \\nportly knight who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of charred \\nmeat and onions still hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry she was. She ate standing in \\nthe yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh mules. The hot juices ran down her chin and \\ndripped onto her cloak, but she was too famished to care. \\nThen it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second part of the ascent seemed \\nmore treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the steps more worn, and here and there littered with \\npebbles and broken stone. Mya had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. \\n\"You don\\'t want your mule to break a leg up here,\" she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. She could feel \\nthe altitude more now. The trees were sparser up here, and the wind blew more vigorously, sharp gusts \\nthat tugged at her clothing \\nand pushed her hair into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she \\ncould see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no brighter than \\ncandles. \\nSnow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and stable hidden behind a low \\nwall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the Giant\\'s Lance in such a way as to command the entire \\nstone stair above the lower waycastle. An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from \\nStone step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The commander, an anxious \\nyoung knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and cheese and the chance to warm themselves \\nbefore his fire, but Mya declined. \"We ought to keep going, my lady,\" she said. \"If it please you.\" Catelyn \\nPage 247\\n\\nnodded. \\nAgain they were given fresh mules. Hers was white. Mya smiled when she saw him. \"Whitey\\'s a good \\none, my lady. Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to be careful. He\\'ll kick if he doesn\\'t like you.\" \\nThe white mule seemed to like Catelyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods. There was no ice either, \\nand she was grateful for that as well. \"My mother says that hundreds of years ago, this was where the \\nsnow began,\" Mya told her. \"It was always white above here, and the ice never melted.\" She shrugged. \"I \\ncan\\'t remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way once, in the \\nolden times.\" \\nSo young, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that. The girl had lived half her \\nlife in summer, and that was all she knew. Winter is coming, child, she wanted to tell her. The words \\nwere on her lips; she almost said them. Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last. \\nAbove Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in the waste, then falling off to \\nnothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars seemed brighter up here, so close that she could \\nalmost touch them, and the horned moon was huge in the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn \\nfound it was better to look up than down. The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze \\nand thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her heart in her throat. \\nWhen they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, Mya dismounted. \"It\\'s best to lead the \\nmules over,\" she said. \"The wind can be a little scary here, my lady.\" \\nCatelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty feet long and close to \\nthree feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to either side. She could hear the wind shrieking. Mya \\nstepped lightly out, her mule following as calmly as if they were crossing \\na bailey. It was her turn. Yet no sooner had she taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its \\njaws. She could feel the emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her. She stopped, \\ntrembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, trying to pull her over \\nthe edge. Catelyn edged her foot backward, the most timid of steps, but the mule was behind her, and \\nshe could not retreat. I am going to die here, she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her \\nback. \\n\"Lady Stark,\" Mya called across the gulf. The girl sounded a thousand leagues away. \"Are you well?\" \\nCatelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride. \"I . . . I cannot do this, child,\" she called out. \\n\"Yes you can,\" the bastard girl said. \"I know you can. Look how wide the path is.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want to look.\" The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain and sky and mules, \\nwhirling like a child\\'s top. Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her ragged breathing. \\n\"I\\'ll come back for you,\" Mya said. \"Don\\'t move, my lady.\" \\nMoving was about the last thing Catelyn was about to do. She listened to the skirling of the wind and the \\nscuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was there, taking her gently by the arm. \"Keep your eyes \\nclosed if you like. Let go of the rope now, Whitey will take care of himself. Very good, my lady. I\\'ll lead \\nyou over, it\\'s easy, you\\'ll see. Give me a step now. That\\'s it, move your foot, just slide it forward. See. \\nPage 248\\n\\nNow another. Easy. You could run across. Another one, go on. Yes.\" And so, foot by foot, step by \\nstep, the bastard girl led Catelyn across, blind and trembling, while the white mule followed placidly \\nbehind them. \\nThe waycastle called Sky was no more than a high, crescent-shaped wall of unmortared stone raised \\nagainst the side of the mountain, but even the topless towers of Valyria could not have looked more \\nbeautiful to Catelyn Stark. Here at last the snow crown began; Sky\\'s weathered stones were rimed with \\nfrost, and long spears of ice hung from the slopes above. \\nDawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone hallooed for the guards, and the gates opened before \\nthem. Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a great tumble of boulders and stones of all \\nsizes. No doubt it would be the easiest thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here. A mouth \\nyawned in the rock face in front of them. \"The stables and barracks are in there,\" Mya said. \"The last part \\nis inside the mountain. It can be a little dark, but at least you\\'re out of the wind. This is as far as the mules \\ncan go. Past here, well, it\\'s a sort of \\nchimney, more like a stone ladder than proper steps, but it\\'s not too bad. Another hour and we\\'ll be \\nthere.\" \\nCatelyn looked up. Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the foundations of the Eyrie. \\nIt could not be more than six hundred feet above them. From below it looked like a small white \\nhoneycomb. She remembered what her uncle had said of baskets and winches. \"The Lannisters may \\nhave their pride,\" she told Mya, \"but the Tullys are born with better sense. I have ridden all day and the \\nbest part of a night. Tell them to lower a basket. I shall ride with the turnips.\" \\nThe sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the Eyrie. A stocky, \\nsilver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the \\nbasket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn\\'s household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon, \\nthin and nervous, with too little hair and too much neck. \"Lady Stark,\" Ser Vardis said, \"the pleasure is as \\ngreat as it is unanticipated.\" Maester Colemon bobbed his head in agreement. \"Indeed it is, my lady, \\nindeed it is. I have sent word to your sister. She left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.\" \\n\"I hope she had a good night\\'s rest,\" Catelyn said with a certain bite in her tone that seemed to go \\nunnoticed. \\nThe men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair. The Eyrie was a small castle by the \\nstandards of the great houses; seven slender white towers bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a \\nshoulder of the great mountain. It had no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels, but Ned said its \\ngranary was as large as Winterfell\\'s, and its towers could house five hundred men. Yet it seemed \\nstrangely deserted to Catelyn as she passed through it, its pale stone halls echoing and empty. \\nLysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her long auburn hair tumbled unbound \\nacross bare white shoulders and down her back. A maid stood behind her, brushing out the night\\'s \\ntangles, but when Catelyn entered, her sister rose to her feet, smiling. \"Cat,\" she said. \"Oh, Cat, how \\ngood it is to see you. My sweet sister.\" She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her arms. \\n\"How long it has been,\" Lysa murmured against her. \"Oh, how very very long.\" \\nIt had been five years, in truth; five cruel years, for Lysa. They had taken their toll. Her sister was two \\nyears the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than Catelyn, Lysa had grown thick of body, pale \\nPage 249\\n\\nand puffy of face. She had the blue eyes of the Tullys, but hers were pale and watery, never still. Her \\nsmall mouth had turned petulant. As \\nCatelyn held her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted girl who\\'d waited beside her that day in the \\nsept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of hope she had been. All that remained of her sister\\'s beauty was \\nthe great fall of thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist. \\n\"You look well,\" Catelyn lied, \"but . . . tired.\" \\nHer sister broke the embrace. \"Tired. Yes. Oh, yes.\" She seemed to notice the others then; her maid, \\nMaester Colemon, Ser Vardis. \"Leave us,\" she told them. \"I wish to speak to my sister alone.\" She held \\nCatelyn\\'s hand as they withdrew . . . \\n. . . and dropped it the instant the door closed. Catelyn saw her face change. It was as if the sun had \\ngone behind a cloud. \"Have you taken leave of your senses?\" Lysa snapped at her. \"To bring him here, \\nwithout a word of permission, without so much as a warning, to drag us into your quarrels with the \\nLannisters . . .\" \\n\"My quarrels?\" Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing. A great fire burned in the hearth, but \\nthere was no trace of warmth in Lysa\\'s voice. \"They were your quarrels first, sister. It was you who sent \\nme that cursed letter, you who wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband.\" \\n\"To warn you, so you could stay away from them! I never meant to fight them! Gods, Cat, do you know \\nwhat you\\'ve done?\" \\n\"Mother?\" a small voice said. Lysa whirled, her heavy robe swirling around her. Robert Arryn, Lord of \\nthe Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth doll and looking at them with large eyes. He \\nwas a painfully thin child, small for his age and sickly all his days, and from time to time he trembled. The \\nshaking sickness, the maesters called it. \"I heard voices.\" \\nSmall wonder, Catelyn thought; Lysa had almost been shouting. Still, her sister looked daggers at her. \\n\"This is your aunt Catelyn, baby. My sister, Lady Stark. Do you remember?\" \\nThe boy glanced at her blankly. \"I think so,\" he said, blinking, though he had been less than a year old \\nthe last time Catelyn had seen him. \\nLysa seated herself near the fire and said, \"Come to Mother, my sweet one.\" She straightened his \\nbedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair. \"Isn\\'t he beautiful? And strong too, don\\'t you believe the \\nthings you hear. Jon knew. The seed is strong, he told me. His last words. He kept saying Robert\\'s name, \\nand he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks. Tell them, the seed is strong. His seed. He wanted \\neveryone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.\" \\n\"Lysa,\" Catelyn said, \"if you\\'re right about the Lannisters, all the more reason we must act quickly. We-\" \\n\"Not in front of the baby,\" Lysa said. \"He has a delicate temper, don\\'t you, sweet one?\" \\n\"The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,\" Catelyn reminded her, \"and these are no times \\nPage 250\\n\\nfor delicacy. Ned thinks it may come to war.\" \\n\"Quiet!\" Lysa snapped at her. \"You\\'re scaring the boy.\" Little Robert took a quick peek over his \\nshoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the rushes, and he pressed himself against his \\nmother. \"Don\\'t be afraid, my sweet baby,\" Lysa whispered. \"Mother\\'s here, nothing will hurt you.\" She \\nopened her robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it eagerly, \\nburied his face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa stroked his hair. \\nCatelyn was at a loss for words. Jon Anyn\\'s son, she thought incredulously. She remembered her own \\nbaby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and five times as fierce. Small wonder the lords of \\nthe Vale were restive. For the first time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away \\nfrom his mother to foster with the Lannisters . . . \\n\"We\\'re safe here,\" Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn was not sure. \\n\"Don\\'t be a fool,\" Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. \"No one is safe. If you think hiding here will make \\nthe Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken.\" \\nLysa covered her boy\\'s ear with her hand. \"Even if they could bring an army through the mountains and \\npast the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable. You saw for yourself. No enemy could ever reach us up \\nhere.\" \\nCatelyn wanted to slap her. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her, she realized. \"No castle is \\nimpregnable.\" \\n\"This one is,\" Lysa insisted. \"Everyone says so. The only thing is, what am I to do with this Imp you have \\nbrought me?\" \\n\"Is he a bad man?\" the Lord of the Eyrie asked, his mother\\'s breast popping from his mouth, the nipple \\nwet and red. \\n\"A very bad man,\" Lysa told him as she covered herself, \"but Mother won\\'t let him harm my little baby.\" \\n\"Make him fly,\" Robert said eagerly. \\nLysa stroked her son\\'s hair. \"Perhaps we will,\" she murmured. \"Perhaps that is just what we will do.\" \\nEDDARD \\nHe found Littlefinger in the brothel\\'s common room, chatting amiably with a tall, elegant woman who \\nwore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink. By the hearth, Heward and a buxom wench were \\nplaying at forfeits. From the look of it, he\\'d lost his belt, his cloak, his mail shirt, and his right boot so far, \\nwhile the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist. Jory Cassel stood beside a rain-streaked \\nwindow with a wry smile on his face, watching Heward turn over tiles and enjoying the view. \\nPage 251\\n\\nNed paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves. \"It\\'s time we took our leave. My business \\nhere is done.\" \\nHeward lurched to his feet, hurriedly gathering up his things. \"As you will, my lord,\" Jory said. \"I\\'ll help \\nWyl bring round the horses.\" He strode to the door. \\nLittlefinger took his time saying his farewells. He kissed the black woman\\'s hand, whispered some joke \\nthat made her laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned. \"Your business,\" he said lightly, \"or Robert\\'s? \\nThey say the Hand dreams the king\\'s dreams, speaks with the king\\'s voice, and rules with the king\\'s \\nsword. Does that also mean you fuck with the king\\'s-\" \\n\"Lord Baelish,\" Ned interrupted, \"you presume too much. I am not ungrateful for your help. It might have \\ntaken us years to find this \\nbrothel without you. That does not mean I intend to endure your mockery. And I am no longer the \\nKing\\'s Hand.\" \\n\"The direwolf must be a prickly beast,\" said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of his mouth. \\nA warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the stables. Ned drew up the \\nhood of his cloak. Jory brought out his horse. Young Wyl came right behind him, leading Littlefinger\\'s \\nmare with one hand while the other fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers. A barefoot \\nwhore leaned out of the stable door, giggling at him. \\n\"Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?\" Jory asked. Ned nodded and swung into the \\nsaddle. Littlefinger mounted up beside him. Jory and the others followed. \\n\"Chataya runs a choice establishment,\" Littlefinger said as they rode. \"I\\'ve half a mind to buy it. Brothels \\nare a much sounder investment than ships, I\\'ve found. Whores seldom sink, and when they are boarded \\nby pirates, why, the pirates pay good coin like everyone else.\" Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit. \\nNed let him prattle on. After a time, he quieted and they rode in silence. The streets of King\\'s Landing \\nwere dark and deserted. The rain had driven everyone under their roofs. It beat down on Ned\\'s head, \\nwarm as blood and relentless as old guilts. Fat drops of water ran down his face. \\n\"Robert will never keep to one bed,\" Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on the night long ago when their \\nfather had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm\\'s End. \"I hear he has gotten a child on some \\ngirl in the Vale.\" Ned had held the babe in his arms; he could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his \\nsister, but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that he was a \\ngood man and true who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only smiled. \"Love is sweet, \\ndearest Ned, but it cannot change a man\\'s nature.\" \\nThe girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age. No doubt she\\'d been a virgin; the better \\nbrothels could always find a virgin, if the purse was fat enough. She had light red hair and a powdering of \\nfreckles across the bridge of her nose, and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, \\nhe saw that her bosom was freckled as well. \"I named her Barra,\" she said as the child nursed. \"She \\nlooks so like him, does she not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair . . .\" \\n\"She does.\" Eddard Stark had touched the baby\\'s fine, dark hair. It \\nPage 252\\n\\nflowed through his fingers like black silk. Robert\\'s firstborn had had the same fine hair, he seemed to \\nrecall. \\n\"Tell him that when you see him, milord, as it ... as it please you. Tell him how beautiful she is.\" \\n\"I will,\" Ned had promised her. That was his curse. Robert would swear undying love and forget them \\nbefore evenfall, but Ned Stark kept his vows. He thought of the promises he\\'d made Lyanna as she lay \\ndying, and the price he\\'d paid to keep them. \\n\"And tell him I\\'ve not been with no one else. I swear it, milord, by the old gods and new. Chataya said I \\ncould have half a year, for the baby, and for hoping he\\'d come back. So you\\'ll tell him I\\'m waiting, won\\'t \\nyou? I don\\'t want no jewels or nothing, just him. He was always good to me, truly.\" \\nGood to you, Ned thought hollowly. \"I will tell him, child, and I promise you, Barra shall not go \\nwanting.\" \\nShe had smiled then, a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of him. Riding through the \\nrainy night, Ned saw Jon Snow\\'s face in front of him, so like a younger version of his own. If the gods \\nfrowned so on bastards, he thought dully, why did they fill men with such lusts? \"Lord Baelish, what do \\nyou know of Robert\\'s bastards?\" \\n\"Well, he has more than you, for a start.\" \\n\"How many?\" \\nLittlefinger shrugged. Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his cloak. \"Does it matter? If you \\nbed enough women, some will give you presents, and His Grace has never been shy on that count. I \\nknow he\\'s acknowledged that boy at Storm\\'s End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed. He \\ncould hardly do otherwise. The mother was a Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of her bedmaids. \\nRenly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and broke in the wedding bed while \\nStannis and his bride were still dancing. Lord Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his \\nwife\\'s House, so when the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly.\" He gave Ned a sideways glance. \\n\"I\\'ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair of twins on a serving wench at Casterly Rock, three \\nyears ago when he went west for Lord Tywin\\'s tourney. Cersei had the babes killed, and sold the mother \\nto a passing slaver. Too much an affront to Lannister pride, that close to home.\" \\nNed Stark grimaced. Ugly tales like that were told of every great lord in the realm. He could believe it of \\nCersei Lannister readily enough . . . but would the king stand by and let it happen? The Robert he had \\nknown would not have, but the Robert he had known had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to \\nthings he did not \\nwish to see. \"Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king\\'s baseborn children?\" \\nThe short man gave a sodden shrug. \"He was the King\\'s Hand. Doubtless Robert asked him to see that \\nthey were provided for.\" \\nPage 253\\n\\nNed was soaked through to the bone, and his soul had grown cold. \"It had to be more than that, or why \\nkill him?\" \\nLittlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed. \"Now I see. Lord Arryn learned that His Grace had \\nfilled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for that he had to be silenced. Small wonder. Allow a \\nman like that to live, and next he\\'s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east.\" \\nThere was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first time in years, he found \\nhimself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he \\nthought not. \\nThe rain was falling harder now, stinging the eyes and drumming against the ground. Rivers of black \\nwater were running down the hill when Jory called out, \"My lord, \" his voice hoarse with alarm. And in an \\ninstant, the street was full of soldiers. \\nNed glimpsed ringmail over leather, gauntlets and greaves, steel helms with golden lions on the crests. \\nTheir cloaks clung to their backs, sodden with rain. He had no time to count, but there were ten at least, \\na line of them, on foot, blocking the street, with longswords and irontipped spears. \"Behind!\" he heard \\nWyl cry, and when he turned his horse, there were more in back of them, cutting off their retreat. Jory\\'s \\nsword came singing from its scabbard. \"Make way or die!\" \\n\"The wolves are howling,\" their leader said. Ned could see rain running down his face. \"Such a small \\npack, though.\" \\nLittlefinger walked his horse forward, step by careful step. \"What is the meaning of this? This is the Hand \\nof the King.\" \\n\"He was the Hand of the King.\" The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay stallion. The line parted \\nbefore him. On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister roared its defiance. \"Now, if truth be told, I\\'m \\nnot sure what he is.\" \\n\"Lannister, this is madness,\" Littlefinger said. \"Let us pass. We are expected back at the castle. What do \\nyou think you\\'re doing?\" \\n\"He knows what he\\'s doing,\" Ned said calmly. \\nJaime Lannister smiled. \"Quite true. I\\'m looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don\\'t you, \\nLord Stark? He was with us at Winterfell. Fair-haired, mismatched eyes, sharp of tongue. A short man.\" \\n\"I remember him well,\" Ned replied. \\n\"It would seem he has met some trouble on the road. My lord father is quite vexed. You would not \\nperchance have any notion of who might have wished my brother ill, would you?\" \\n\"Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes,\" Ned Stark said. \\nLittlefinger groaned in dismay. \"My lords-\" \\nSer Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward. \"Show me your steel, \\nPage 254\\n\\nLord Eddard. I\\'ll butcher you like Aerys if I must, but I\\'d sooner you died with a blade in your hand.\" He \\ngave Littlefinger a cool, contemptuous glance. \"Lord Baelish, I\\'d leave here in some haste if I did not care \\nto get bloodstains on my costly clothing.\" \\nLittlefinger did not need to be urged. \"I will bring the City Watch,\" he promised Ned. The Lannister line \\nparted to let him through, and closed behind him. Littlefinger put his heels to his mare and vanished \\naround a corner. \\nNed\\'s men had drawn their swords, but they were three against twenty. Eyes watched from nearby \\nwindows and doors, but no one was about to intervene. His party was mounted, the Lannisters on foot \\nsave for Jaime himself. A charge might win them free, but it seemed to Eddard Stark that they had a \\nsurer, safer tactic. \"Kill me,\" he warned the Kingslayer, \"and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion.\" \\nJaime Lannister poked at Ned\\'s chest with the gilded sword that had sipped the blood of the last of the \\nDragonkings. \"Would she? The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage? I think . . . not.\" He \\nsighed. \"But I am not willing to chance my brother\\'s life on a woman\\'s honor.\" Jaime slid the golden \\nsword into its sheath. \"So I suppose I\\'ll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened you. I \\nwonder if he\\'ll care.\" Jaime pushed his wet hair back with his fingers and wheeled his horse around. \\nWhen he was beyond the line of swordsmen, he glanced back at his captain. \"Tregar, see that no harm \\ncomes to Lord Stark.\" \\n\"As you say, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"Still . . . we wouldn\\'t want him to leave here entirely unchastened, so\"-through the night and the rain, he \\nglimpsed the white of Jaime\\'s smile-\"kill his men.\" \\n\"No!\" Ned Stark screamed, clawing for his sword. Jaime was already cantering off down the street as \\nhe heard Wyl shout. Men closed from both sides. Ned rode one down, cutting at phantoms in red cloaks \\nwho gave way before him. Jory Cassel put his heels into his mount and charged. A steel-shod hoof \\ncaught a Lannister guardsman in the face with a sickening crunch. A second man reeled away and for an \\ninstant \\nJory was free. Wyl cursed as they pulled him off his dying horse, swords slashing in the rain. Ned \\ngalloped to him, bringing his longsword down on Tregar\\'s helm. The jolt of impact made him grit his \\nteeth. Tregar stumbled to his knees, his lion crest sheared in half, blood running down his face. Heward \\nwas hacking at the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear caught him in the belly. Suddenly Jory \\nwas back among them, a red rain flying from his sword. \"No!\" Ned shouted. \"Jory, away!\" Ned\\'s horse \\nslipped under him and came crashing down in the mud. There was a moment of blinding pain and the \\ntaste of blood in his mouth. \\nHe saw them cut the legs from Jory\\'s mount and drag him to the earth, swords rising and failing as they \\nclosed in around him. When Ned\\'s horse lurched back to its feet, he tried to rise, only to fall again, \\nchoking on his scream. He could see the splintered bone poking through his calf. It was the last thing he \\nsaw for a time. The rain came down and down and down. \\nWhen he opened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. His horse moved closer, \\ncaught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned began to drag himself through the mud, gritting \\nhis teeth at the agony in his leg. It seemed to take years. Faces watched from candlelit windows, and \\npeople began to emerge from alleys and doors, but no one moved to help. \\nPage 255\\n\\nLittlefinger and the City Watch found him there in the street, cradling Jory Cassel\\'s body in his arms. \\nSomewhere the gold cloaks found a litter, but the trip back to the castle was a blur of agony, and Ned \\nlost consciousness more than once. He remembered seeing the Red Keep looming ahead of him in the \\nfirst grey light of dawn. The rain had darkened the pale pink stone of the massive walls to the color of \\nblood. \\nThen Grand Maester Pycelle was looming over him, holding a cup, whispering, \"Drink, my lord. Here. \\nThe milk of the poppy, for your pain.\" He remembered swallowing, and Pycelle was telling someone to \\nheat the wine to boiling and fetch him clean silk, and that was the last he knew. \\nDAENERYS \\nThe Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak was made of two gigantic bronze stallions, rearing, their hooves \\nmeeting a hundred feet above the roadway to form a pointed arch. \\nDany could not have said why the city needed a gate when it had no walls . . . and no buildings that she \\ncould see. Yet there it stood, immense and beautiful, the great horses framing the distant purple mountain \\nbeyond. The bronze stallions threw long shadows across the waving grasses as Khal Drogo led the \\nkhalasar under their hooves and down the godsway, his bloodriders beside him. \\nDany followed on her silver, escorted by Ser Jorah Mormont and her brother Viserys, mounted once \\nmore. After the day in the grass when she had left him to walk back to the khalasar, the Dothraki had \\nlaughingly called him Khal Rhae Mhar, the Sorefoot King. Khal Drogo had offered him a place in a cart \\nthe next day, and Viserys had accepted. In his stubborn ignorance, he had not even known he was being \\nmocked; the carts were for eunuchs, cripples, women giving birth, the very young and the very old. That \\nwon him yet another name: Khal Rhaggat, the Cart King. Her brother had thought it was the khal\\'s way \\nof apologizing for the wrong Dany had done him. She had begged Ser Jorah not to tell him the truth, lest \\nhe be shamed. The knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of shame . . . yet he had done \\nas she bid. It had taken much pleading, and all the \\npillow tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and allow Viserys \\nto rejoin them at the head of the column. \\n\"Where is the city?\" she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch. There were no buildings to be \\nseen, no people, only the grass and the road, lined with ancient monuments from all the lands the \\nDothraki had sacked over the centuries. \\n\"Ahead,\" Ser Jorah answered. \"Under the mountain.\" \\nBeyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side of them. The forgotten \\ndeities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at the sky as Dany rode her silver past their \\nfeet. Stone kings looked down on her from their thrones, their faces chipped and stained, even their \\nnames lost in the mists of time. Lithe young maidens danced on marble plinths, draped only in flowers, or \\npoured air from shattered jars. Monsters stood in the grass beside the road; black iron dragons with \\njewels for eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with their barbed tails poised to strike, and other beasts she \\nPage 256\\n\\ncould not name. Some of the statues were so lovely they took her breath away, others so misshapen and \\nterrible that Dany could scarcely bear to look at them. Those, Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the \\nShadow Lands beyond Asshai. \\n\"So many,\" she said as her silver stepped slowly onward, \"and from so many lands.\" \\nViserys was less impressed. \"The trash of dead cities,\" he sneered. He was careful to speak in the \\nCommon Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet even so Dany found herself glancing back \\nat the men of her khas, to make certain he had not been overheard. He went on blithely. \"All these \\nsavages know how to do is steal the things better men have built . . . and kill.\" He laughed. \"They do \\nknow how to kill. Otherwise I\\'d have no use for them at all.\" \\n\"They are my people now,\" Dany said. \"You should not call them savages, brother.\" \\n\"The dragon speaks as he likes,\" Viserys said . . . in the Common Tongue. He glanced over his shoulder \\nat Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored them with a mocking smile. \"See, the savages \\nlack the wit to understand the speech of civilized men.\" A mosseaten stone monolith loomed over the \\nroad, fifty feet tall. Viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes. \"How long must we linger amidst these \\nruins before Drogo gives me my army? I grow tired of waiting.\" \\n\"The princess must be presented to the dosh khaleen . . .\" \\n\"The crones, yes,\" her brother interrupted, \"and there\\'s to be some mummer\\'s show of a prophecy for \\nthe whelp in her belly, you told me. \\nWhat is that to me? I\\'m tired of eating horsemeat and I\\'m sick of the stink of these savages.\" He sniffed \\nat the wide, floppy sleeve of his tunic, where it was his custom to keep a sachet. It could not have helped \\nmuch. The tunic was filthy. All the silk and heavy wools that Viserys had worn out of Pentos were stained \\nby hard travel and rotted from sweat. \\nSer Jorah Mormont said, \"The Western Market will have food more to your taste, Your Grace. The \\ntraders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares. The khal will honor his promise in his own \\ntime.\" \\n\"He had better,\" Viserys said grimly. \"I was promised a crown, and I mean to have it. The dragon is not \\nmocked.\" Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with six breasts and a ferret\\'s head, he rode off to \\ninspect it more closely. \\nDany was relieved, yet no less anxious. \"I pray that my sun-andstars will not keep him waiting too long,\" \\nshe told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot. \\nThe knight looked after Viserys doubtfully. \"Your brother should have bided his time in Pentos. There is \\nno place for him in a khalasar. Illyrio tried to warn him.\" \\n\"He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand. My lord husband promised a golden crown.\" \\nSer Jorah grunted. \"Yes, Khaleesi, but . . . the Dothraki look on these things differently than we do in the \\nwest. I have told him as much, as Illyrio told him, but your brother does not listen. The horselords are no \\ntraders. Viserys thinks he sold you, and now he wants his price. Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you \\nPage 257\\n\\nas a gift. He will give Viserys a gift in return, yes . . . in his own time. You do not demand a gift, not of a \\nkhaL You do not demand anything of a khal.\" \\n\"It is not right to make him wait.\" Dany did not know why she was defending her brother, yet she was. \\n\"Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers.\" \\nSer Jorah snorted. \"Viserys could not sweep a stable with ten thousand brooms.\" \\nDany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone. \"What . . . what if it were not Viserys?\" she \\nasked. \"If it were someone else who led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki truly conquer the \\nSeven Kingdoms?\" \\nSer Jorah\\'s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the godsway. \"When I first went into \\nexile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked barbarians, as wild as their horses. If you had asked \\nme then, Princess, I should have told you that a thousand good \\nknights would have no trouble putting to flight a hundred times as many Dothraki.\" \\n\"But if I asked you now?\" \\n\"Now,\" the knight said, \"I am less certain. They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and \\ntheir bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or \\na barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no \\nmatter, they are full as deadly . . . and there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone \\ncounts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar.\" \\n\"Is that truly so many?\" \\n\"Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident,\" Ser Jorah admitted, \"but of that number, \\nno more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears \\nand pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field. How long do you \\nimagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? \\nHow well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?\" \\n\"Not long,\" she said, \"not well.\" \\nHe nodded. \"Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a \\ngoose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the \\nweakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle . . \\n.\" \\n\"Is he?\" Dany asked. \"A fool, I mean?\" \\nSer Jorah considered that for a moment. \"Robert should have been born Dothraki,\" he said at last. \\n\"Your khal would tell you that only a coward hides behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a \\nblade in hand. The Usurper would agree. He is a strong man, brave . . . and rash enough to meet a \\nDothraki horde in the open field. But the men around him, well, their pipers play a different tune. His \\nbrother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark He spat. \\nPage 258\\n\\n\"You hate this Lord Stark,\" Dany said. \\n\"He took from me all I loved, for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and his precious honor,\" Ser \\nJorah said bitterly. From his tone, she could tell the loss still pained him. He changed the subject quickly. \\n\"There,\" he announced, pointing. \"Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.\" \\nKhal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the Western Market, down the \\nbroad ways beyond. Dany followed close on her silver, staring at the strangeness about her. Vaes \\nDothrak \\nwas at once the largest city and the smallest that she had ever known. She tho \\' ught it must be ten times \\nas large as Pentos, a vastness without walls or limits, its broad windswept streets paved in grass and mud \\nand carpeted with wildflowers. In the Free Cities of the west, towers and manses and hovels and bridges \\nand shops and halls all crowded in on one another, but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously, baking in \\nthe warm sun, ancient, arrogant, and empty. \\nEven the buildings were so queer to her eyes. She saw carved stone pavilions, manses of woven grass \\nas large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids faced with marble, log halls open to the \\nsky. In place of walls, some palaces were surrounded by thorny hedges. \"None of them are alike,\" she \\nsaid. \\n\"Your brother had part of the truth,\" Ser Jorah admitted. \"The Dothraki do not build. A thousand years \\nago, to make a house, they would dig a hole in the earth and cover it with a woven grass roof. The \\nbuildings you see were made by slaves brought here from lands they\\'ve plundered, and they built each \\nafter the fashion of their own peoples.\" \\nMost of the halls, even the largest, seemed deserted. \"Where are the people who live here?\" Dany \\nasked. The bazaar had been full of running children and men shouting, but elsewhere she had seen only a \\nfew eunuchs going about their business. \\n\"Only the crones of the dosh khaleen dwell permanently in the sacred city, them and their slaves and \\nservants,\" Ser Jorah replied, \"yet Vaes Dothrak is large enough to house every man of every khalasar, \\nshould all the khals return to the Mother at once. The crones have prophesied that one day that will come \\nto pass, and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children.\" \\nKhal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans from Yi Ti and Asshai and \\nthe Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of Mountains looming overhead. Dany smiled as she \\nrecalled Magister Illyrio\\'s slave girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid \\nsilver. The \"palace\" was a cavernous wooden feasting hall, its rough-hewn timbered walls rising forty feet, \\nits roof sewn silk, a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep out the rare rains, or lowered to admit \\nthe endless sky. Around the hall were broad grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges, firepits, and \\nhundreds of round earthen houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills, covered with grass. \\nA small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo\\'s arrival. As each rider swung down \\nfrom his saddle, he unbelted his arakh and handed it to a waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried \\nas well. Even Khal Drogo himself was not exempt. Ser Jorah \\n344 GEORGE R.R. MARUN \\nPage 259\\n\\nhad explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a free man\\'s blood. \\nEven warring khalasars put aside their feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in sight \\nof the Mother of Mountains. In this place, the crones of the dosh khaleen had decreed, all Dothraki were \\none blood, one khalasar, one herd. \\nCohollo came to Dany as Irri and Jhiqui were helping her down off her silver. He was the oldest of \\nDrogo\\'s three bloodriders, a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth, \\nshattered by a mace twenty years before when he saved the young khalakka from sellswords who hoped \\nto sell him to his father\\'s enemies. His life had been bound to Drogo\\'s the day her lord husband was born. \\nEvery khal had his bloodriders. At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki Kingsguard, \\nsworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more \\nthan a guard; they were the khal\\'s brothers, his shadows, his fiercest friends. \"Blood of my blood,\" Drogo \\ncalled them, and so it was; they shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded \\nthat when the khal died, his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died \\nat the hands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him joyfully \\ninto the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal\\'s wine, his tent, and even \\nhis wives, though never his horses. A man\\'s mount was his own. \\nDaenerys was glad that Khal Drogo did not hold to those ancient ways. She should not have liked being \\nshared. And while old Cohollo treated her kindly enough, the others frightened her; Haggo, huge and \\nsilent, often glowered as if he had forgotten who she was, and Qotho had cruel eyes and quick hands that \\nliked to hurt. He left bruises on Doreah\\'s soft white skin whenever he touched her, and sometimes made \\nIrri sob in the night. Even his horses seemed to fear him. \\nYet they were bound to Drogo for life and death, so Daenerys had no choice but to accept them. And \\nsometimes she found herself wishing her father had been protected by such men. In the songs, the white \\nknights of the Kingsguard were ever noble, valiant, and true, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by \\none of them, the handsome boy they now called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the Bold, \\nhad gone over to the Usurper. She wondered if all men were as false in the Seven Kingdoms. When her \\nson sat the Iron Throne, she would see that he had bloodriders of his own to protect him against \\ntreachery in his Kingsguard. \\n\"Khaleesi, \" Cohollo said to her, in Dothraki. \"Drogo, who is blood \\nof my blood, commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this night, to \\nsacrifice to the gods for his safe return.\" \\nOnly men were allowed to set foot on the Mother, Dany knew. The khal\\'s bloodriders would go with \\nhim, and return at dawn. \"Tell my sun-and-stars that I dream of him, and wait anxious for his return,\" she \\nreplied, thankful. Dany tired more easily as the child grew within her; in truth, a night of rest would be \\nmost welcome. Her pregnancy only seemed to have inflamed Drogo\\'s desire for her, and of late his \\nembraces left her exhausted. \\nDoreah led her to the hollow hill that had been prepared for her and her khaL It was cool and dim \\nwithin, like a tent made of earth. \"Jhiqui, a bath, please,\" she commanded, to wash the dust of travel from \\nher skin and soak her weary bones. It was pleasant to know that they would linger here for a while, that \\nshe would not need to climb back on her silver on the morrow. \\nPage 260\\n\\nThe water was scalding hot, as she liked it. \"I will give my brother his gifts tonight,\" she decided as Jhiqui \\nwas washing her hair. \"He should look a king in the sacred city. Doreah, run and find him and invite him \\nto sup with me.\" Viserys was nicer to the Lysene girl than to her Dothraki handmaids, perhaps because \\nMagister Illyrio had let him bed her back in Pentos. \"Irri, go to the bazaar and buy fruit and meat. \\nAnything but horseflesh.\" \\n\"Horse is best,\" Irri said. \"Horse makes a man strong.\" \\n\"Viserys hates horsemeat.\" \\n\"As you say, Khaleesi. \" \\nShe brought back a haunch of goat and a basket of fruits and vegetables. Jhiqui roasted the meat with \\nsweetgrass and firepods, basting it with honey as it cooked, and there were melons and pomegranates \\nand plums and some queer eastern fruit Dany did not know. While her handmaids prepared the meal, \\nDany laid out the clothing she\\'d had made to her brother\\'s measure: a tunic and leggings of crisp white \\nlinen, leather sandals that laced up to the knee, a bronze medallion belt, a leather vest painted with \\nfire-breathing dragons. The Dothraki would respect him more if he looked less a beggar, she hoped, and \\nperhaps he would forgive her for shaming him that day in the grass. He was still her king, after all, and her \\nbrother. They were both blood of the dragon. \\nShe was arranging the last of his gifts-a sandsilk cloak, green as grass, with a pale grey border that \\nwould bring out the silver in his hair-when Viserys arrived, dragging Doreah by the arm. Her eye was red \\nwhere he\\'d hit her. \"How dare you send this whore to give me commands,\" he said. He shoved the \\nhandmaid roughly to the carpet. \\nThe anger took Dany utterly by surprise. \"I only wanted ... Doreah, what did you say?\" \\n\"Khaleesi, pardons, forgive me. I went to him, as you bid, and told him you commanded him to join you \\nfor supper.\" \\n\"No one commands the dragon,\" Viserys snarled. \"I am your king! I should have sent you back her \\nhead!\" \\nThe Lysene girl quailed, but Dany calmed her with a touch. \"Don\\'t be afraid, he won\\'t hurt you. Sweet \\nbrother, please, forgive her, the girl misspoke herself, I told her to ask you to sup with me, if it pleases \\nYour Grace.\" She took him by the hand and drew him across the room. \"Look. These are for you.\" \\nViserys frowned suspiciously. \"What is all this?\" \\n\"New raiment. I had it made for you.\" Dany smiled shyly. \\nHe looked at her and sneered. \"Dothraki rags. Do you presume to dress me now?\" \\n\"Please . . . you\\'ll be cooler and more comfortable, and I thought . . . maybe if you dressed like them, \\nthe Dothraki Dany did not know how to say it without waking his dragon. \\n\"Next you\\'ll want to braid my hair.\" \\nPage 261\\n\\n\"I\\'d never . . .\" Why was he always so cruel? She had only wanted to help. \"You have no right to a \\nbraid, you have won no victories yet.\" \\nIt was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone from his lilac eyes, yet he dared not strike her, not with her \\nhandmaids watching and the warriors of her khas outside. Viserys picked up the cloak and sniffed at it. \\n\"This stinks of manure. Perhaps I shall use it as a horse blanket.\" \\n\"I had Doreah sew it specially for you,\" she told him, wounded. \"These are garments fit for a khaL \" \\n\"I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with bells in his hair,\" Viserys \\nspat back at her. He grabbed her arm. \"You forget yourself, slut. Do you think that big belly will protect \\nyou if you wake the dragon?\" \\nHis fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant Dany felt like a child again, quailing in the face of \\nhis rage. She reached out with her other hand and grabbed the first thing she touched, the belt she\\'d \\nhoped to give him, a heavy chain of ornate bronze medallions. She swung it with all her strength. \\nIt caught him full in the face. Viserys let go of her. Blood ran down his cheek where the edge of one of \\nthe medallions had sliced it open. \"You are the one who forgets himself,\" Dany said to him. \"Didn\\'t you \\nlearn anything that day in the grass? Leave me now, before I summon my khas to drag you out. And pray \\nthat Khal Drogo does not hear of this, or he will cut open your belly and feed you your own entrails.\" \\nViserys scrambled back to his feet. \"When I come into my kingdom, you will rue this day, slut.\" He \\nwalked off, holding his torn face, leaving her gifts behind him. \\nDrops Of his blood had spattered the beautiful sandsilk cloak. Dany clutched the soft cloth to her cheek \\nand sat cross-legged on her sleeping mats. \\n\"Your supper is ready, Khaleesi,\" Jhiqui announced. \\n\"I\\'m not hungry,\" Dany said sadly. She was suddenly very tired. \"Share the food among yourselves, and \\nsend some to Ser Jorah, if you would.\" After a moment she added, \"Please, bring me one of the dragon\\'s \\neggs.\" \\nIrri fetched the egg with the deep green shell, bronze flecks shining amid its scales as she turned it in her \\nsmall hands. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the \\nhollow between her swollen belly and small, tender breasts. She liked to hold them. They were so \\nbeautiful, and sometimes just being close to them made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow she were \\ndrawing strength from the stone dragons locked inside. \\nShe was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt the child move within her . . . as if he were reaching \\nout, brother to brother, blood to blood. \"You are the dragon,\" Dany whispered to him, \"the true dragon. \\nI know it. I know it.\" And she smiled, and went to sleep dreaming of home. \\nBRAN \\nA light snow was falling. Bran could feel the flakes on his face, melting as they touched his skin like the \\nPage 262\\n\\ngentlest of rains. He sat straight atop his horse, watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward. Try \\nas he might to keep calm, his heart was fluttering in his chest. \\n\"Are you ready?\" Robb asked. \\nBran nodded, trying not to let his fear show. He had not been outside Winterfell since his fall, but he was \\ndetermined to ride out as proud as any knight. \\n\"Let\\'s ride, then.\" Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding, and the horse walked under the \\nportcullis. \\n\"Go,\" Bran whispered to his own horse. He touched her neck lightly, and the small chestnut filly started \\nforward. Bran had named her Dancer. She was two years old, and Joseth said she was smarter than any \\nhorse had a right to be. They had trained her special, to respond to rein and voice and touch. Up to now, \\nBran had only ridden her around the yard. At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran sat \\nstrapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but for the past fortnight he \\nhad been riding her on his own, trotting her round and round, and growing bolder with every circuit. \\nThey passed beneath the gatehouse, over the drawbridge, through \\nthe outer walls. Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them, sniffing at the wind. Close behind \\ncame Theon Greyjoy, with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads; he had a mind to take a deer, he \\nhad told them. He was followed by four guardsmen in mailed shirts and coifs, and Joseth, a stick-thin \\nstableman whom Robb had named master of horse while Hullen was away. Maester Luwin brought up \\nthe rear, riding on a donkey. Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone, just the \\ntwo of them, but Hal Mollen would not hear of it, and Maester Luwin backed him. If Bran fell off his \\nhorse or injured himself, the maester was determined to be with him. \\nBeyond the castle lay the market square, its wooden stalls deserted now. They rode down the muddy \\nstreets of the village, past rows of small neat houses of log and undressed stone. Less than one in five \\nwere occupied, thin tendrils of woodsmoke curling up from their chimneys. The rest would fill up one by \\none as it grew colder. When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north, Old Nan \\nsaid, farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up their wagons, and then the winter \\ntown came alive. Bran had never seen it happen, but Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer. \\nThe end of the long summer was near at hand. Winter is coming. \\nA few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one man dropped the wood \\nhe was carrying as he shrank away in fear, but most of the townfolk had grown used to the sight. They \\nbent the knee when they saw the boys, and Robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod. \\nWith his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel unsteady at first, but the \\nhuge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him comfortingly, and the straps around his chest \\nand thighs would not allow him to fall. After a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural. His anxiety \\nfaded, and a tremulous smile crept across his face. \\nTwo serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log, the local alehouse. When Theon \\nGreyjoy called out to them, the younger girl turned red and covered her face. Theon spurred his mount to \\nmove up beside Robb. \"Sweet Kyra,\" he said with a laugh. \"She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a \\nword to her on the street, and she blushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and \\nPage 263\\n\\nBessa-\" \\n\"Not where my brother can hear, Theon,\" Robb warned him with a glance at Bran. \\nBran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel Greyjoy\\'s eyes on him. No doubt \\nhe was smiling. He smiled a lot, \\nas if the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to \\nadmire Theon and enjoy his company, but Bran had never warmed to his father\\'s ward. \\nRobb rode closer. \"You are doing well, Bran.\" \\n\"I want to go faster,\" Bran replied. \\nRobb smiled. \"As you will.\" He sent his gelding into a trot. The wolves raced after him. Bran snapped \\nthe reins sharply, and Dancer picked up her pace. He heard a shout from Theon Greyjoy, and the \\nhoofbeats of the other horses behind him. \\nBran\\'s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush at his face. Robb was well \\nahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time to make sure Bran and the others were \\nfollowing. He snapped the reins again. Smooth as silk, Dancer slid into a gallop. The distance closed. By \\nthe time he caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood, two miles beyond the winter town, they had left \\nthe others well behind. \"I can tide!\" Bran shouted, grinning. It felt almost as good as flying. \\n\"I\\'d race you, but I fear you\\'d win.\" Robb\\'s tone was light and joking, yet Bran could tell that something \\nwas troubling his brother underneath the smile. \\n\"I don\\'t want to race.\" Bran looked around for the direwolves. Both had vanished into the wood. \"Did \\nyou hear Summer howling last night?\" \\n\"Grey Wind was restless too,\" Robb said. His auburn hair had grown shaggy and unkempt, and a \\nreddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his fifteen years. \"Sometimes I think they \\nknow things . . . sense things . . .\" Robb sighed. \"I never know how much to tell you, Bran. I wish you \\nwere older.\" \\n\"I\\'m eight now!\" Bran said. \"Eight isn\\'t so much younger than fifteen, and I\\'m the heir to Winterfell, after \\nyou.\" \\n\"So you are.\" Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared. \"Bran, I need to tell you something. There \\nwas a bird last night. From King\\'s Landing. Maester Luwin woke me.\" \\nBran felt a sudden dread. Dark wings, dark words, Old Nan always said, and of late the messenger \\nravens had been proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb wrote to the Lord Commander of the \\nNight\\'s Watch, the bird that came back brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing. Then a \\nmessage had arrived from the Eyrie, from Mother, but that had not been good news either. She did not \\nsay when she meant to return, only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort of liked the little \\nman, yet the name Lannister sent cold fingers creeping up his spine. There was something about the \\nLannisters, \\nPage 264\\n\\nsomething he ought to remember, but when he tried to think what, he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched \\nhard as a stone. Robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin, Theon \\nGreyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward, riders were sent out on fast horses, carrying Robb\\'s commands \\nthroughout the north. Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin, the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the \\ntop of the Neck. No one ever told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good. \\nAnd now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. \"Was the bird from Mother? Is she \\ncoming home?\" \\n\"The message was from Alyn in King\\'s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And Wyl and Heward as well. \\nMurdered by the Kingslayer.\" Robb lifted his face to the snow, and the flakes melted on his cheeks. \\n\"May the gods give them rest.\" \\nBran did not know what to say. He felt as if he\\'d been punched. Jory had been captain of the household \\nguard at Winterfell since before Bran was born. \"They killed Jory?\" He remembered all the times Jory \\nhad chased him over the roofs. He could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate, or sitting \\nat his accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall, joking as he ate. \"Why would anyone kill Jory?\" \\nRobb shook his head numbly, the pain plain in his eyes. \"I don\\'t know, and . . . Bran, that\\'s not the worst \\nof it. Father was caught beneath a falling horse in the fight. Alyn says his leg was shattered, and . . . \\nMaester Pycelle has given him the milk of the poppy, but they aren\\'t sure when . . . when he . . .\" The \\nsound of hoofbeats made him glance down the road, to where Theon and the others were coming up. \\n\"When he will wake,\" Robb finished. He laid his hand on the pommel of his sword then, and went on in \\nthe solemn voice of Robb the Lord. \"Bran, I promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this be \\nforgotten.\" \\nSomething in his tone made Bran even more fearful. \"What will you do?\" he asked as Theon Greyjoy \\nreined in beside them. \\n\"Theon thinks I should call the banners,\" Robb said. \\n\"Blood for blood.\" For once Greyjoy did not smile. His lean, dark face had a hungry look to it, and \\nblack hair fell down across his eyes. \\n\"Only the lord can call the banners,\" Bran said as the snow drifted down around them. \\n\"If your father dies,\" Theon said, \"Robb will be Lord of Winterfell.\" \\n\"He won\\'t die!\" Bran screamed at him. \\nRobb took his hand. \"He won\\'t die, not Father,\" he said calmly. \\n\"Still ... the honor of the north is in my hands now. When our lord father took his leave of us, he told me \\nto be strong for you and for Rickon. I\\'m almost a man grown, Bran.\" \\nBran shivered. \"I wish Mother was back,\" he said miserably. He looked around for Maester Luwin; his \\ndonkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a rise. \"Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners \\nPage 265\\n\\ntoo?\" \\n\"The maester is timid as an old woman,\" said Theon. \\n\"Father always listened to his counsel,\" Bran reminded his brother. \"Mother too.\" \\n\"I listen to him,\" Robb insisted. \"I listen to everyone.\" \\nThe joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes on his face. Not so long \\nago, the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off to war would have filled him with excitement, \\nbut now he felt only dread. \"Can we go back now?\" he asked. \"I\\'m cold.\" \\nRobb glanced around. \"We need to find the wolves. Can you stand to go a bit longer?\" \\n\"I can go as long as you can.\" Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride short, for fear of saddle \\nsores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his brother. He was sick of the way everyone \\nwas always fussing over him and asking how he was. \\n\"Let\\'s hunt down the hunters, then,\" Robb said. Side by side, they urged their mounts off the kingsroad \\nand struck out into the wolfswood. Theon dropped back and followed well behind them, talking and \\njoking with the guardsmen. \\nIt was nice under the trees. Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins lightly and looking all around \\nhim as they went. He knew this wood, but he had been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as \\nthough he were seeing it for the first time. The smells filled his nostrils; the sharp fresh tang of pine \\nneedles, the earthy odor of wet rotting leaves, the hints of animal musk and distant cooking fires. He \\ncaught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered branches of an oak, and paused \\nto study the silvery web of an empress spider. \\nTheon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no longer hear their voices. From \\nahead came the faint sound of rushing waters. It grew louder until they reached the stream. Tears stung \\nhis eyes. \\n\"Bran?\" Robb asked. \"What\\'s wrong?\" \\nBran shook his head. \"I was just remembering,\" he said. \"Jory brought us here once, to fish for trout. \\nYou and me and Jon. Do you remember?\" \\n\"I remember,\" Robb said, his voice quiet and sad. \\n\"I didn\\'t catch anything,\" Bran said, \"but Jon gave me his fish on the way back to Winterfell. Will we ever \\nsee Jon again?\" \\n\"We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit,\" Robb pointed out. \"Jon will visit too, you\\'ll see.\" \\nThe stream was running high and fast. Robb dismounted and led his gelding across the ford. In the \\ndeepest part of the crossing, the water came up to midthigh. He tied his horse to a tree on the far side, \\nand waded back across for Bran and Dancer. The current foamed around rock and root, and Bran could \\nfeel the spray on his face as Robb led him over. It made him smile. For a moment he felt strong again, \\nPage 266\\n\\nand whole. He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them, right up to the very top, with the \\nwhole forest spread out beneath him. \\nThey were on the far side when they heard the howl, a long rising wail that moved through the trees like \\na cold wind. Bran raised his head to listen. \"Summer,\" he said. No sooner had he spoken than a second \\nvoice joined the first. \\n\"They\\'ve made a kill,\" Robb said as he remounted. \"I\\'d best go and bring them back. Wait here, Theon \\nand the others should be along shortly.\" \\n\"I want to go with you,\" Bran said. \\n\"I\\'ll find them faster by myself.\" Robb spurred his gelding and vanished into the trees. \\nOnce he was gone, the woods seemed to close in around Bran. The snow was falling more heavily now. \\nWhere it touched the ground it melted, but all about him rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of \\nwhite. As he waited, he was conscious of how uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel his legs, hanging \\nuseless in the stirrups, but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing, and the melting snow had \\nsoaked through his gloves to chill his hands. He wondered what was keeping Theon and Maester Luwin \\nand Joseth and the rest. \\nWhen he heard the rustle of leaves, Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn, expecting to see his \\nfriends, but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of the stream were strangers. \\n\"Good day to you,\" he said nervously. One look, and Bran knew they were neither foresters nor \\nfarmers. He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was dressed. His surcoat was new, dark grey wool \\nwith silver buttons, and a heavy silver pin fastened his fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders. His boots and \\ngloves were lined with fur as well. \\n\"All alone, are you?\" said the biggest of them, a bald man with a raw windburnt face. \"Lost in the \\nwolfswood, poor lad.\" \\n\"I\\'m not lost.\" Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking \\nat him. He counted four, but when he turned his head, he saw two others behind him. \"My brother rode \\noff just a moment ago, and my guard will be here shortly.\" \\n\"Your guard, is it?\" a second man said. Grey stubble covered his gaunt face. \"And what would they be \\nguarding, my little lord? Is that a silver pin I see there on your cloak?\" \\n\"Pretty,\" said a woman\\'s voice. She scarcely looked like a woman; tall and lean, with the same hard face \\nas the others, her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped halfhelm. The spear she held was eight feet of black \\noak, tipped in rusted steel. \\n\"Let\\'s have a look,\" said the big bald man. \\nBran watched him anxiously. The man\\'s clothes were filthy, fallen almost to pieces, patched here with \\nbrown and here with blue and there with a dark green, and faded everywhere to grey, but once that \\ncloak might have been black. The grey stubbly man wore black rags too, he saw with a sudden start. \\nPage 267\\n\\nSuddenly Bran remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded, the day they had found the wolf \\npups; that man had worn black as well, and Father said he had been a deserter from the Night\\'s Watch. \\nNo man is more dangerous, he remembered Lord Eddard saying. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if \\nhe is taken, so he will notflinch from any crime, no matter how vile or crueL \\n\"The pin, lad,\" the big man said. He held out his hand. \\n\"We\\'ll take the horse too,\" said another of them, a woman shorter than Robb, with a broad fiat face and \\nlank yellow hair. \"Get down, and be quick about it.\" A knife slid from her sleeve into her hand, its edge \\njagged as a saw. \\n\"No,\" Bran blurted. \"I can\\'t \\nThe big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer around and gallop off. \"You \\ncan, lordling . . . and will, if you know what\\'s good for you.\" \\n\"Stiv, look how he\\'s strapped on.\" The tall woman pointed with her spear. \"Might be it\\'s the truth he\\'s \\ntelling.\" \\n\"Straps, is it?\" Stiv said. He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt. \"There\\'s ways to deal with straps.\" \\n\"You some kind of cripple?\" asked the short woman. \\nBran flared. \"I\\'m Brandon Stark of Winterfell, and you better let go of my horse, or I\\'ll see you all dead.\" \\nThe gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed. \"The boy\\'s a Stark, true enough. Only a Stark would \\nbe fool enough to threaten where smarter men would beg.\" \\n\"Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth,\" suggested the short woman. \"That should shut him up.\" \\n\"You\\'re as stupid as you are ugly, Hali,\" said the tall woman. \"The boy\\'s worth nothing dead, but alive . . \\n. gods be damned, think what Mance would give to have Benjen Stark\\'s own blood to hostage!\" \\n\"Mance be damned,\" the big man cursed. \"You want to go back there, Osha? More fool you. Think the \\nwhite walkers will care if you have a hostage?\" He turned back to Bran and slashed at the strap around \\nhis thigh. The leather parted with a sigh. \\nThe stroke had been quick and careless, biting deep. Looking down, Bran glimpsed pale flesh where the \\nwool of his leggings had parted. Then the blood began to flow. He watched the red stain spread, feeling \\nlight-headed, curiously apart; there had been no pain, not even a hint of feeling. The big man grunted in \\nsurprise. \\n\"Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless death,\" Robb called out. \\nBran looked up in desperate hope, and there he was. The strength of the words were undercut by the \\nway his voice cracked with strain. He was mounted, the bloody carcass of an elk slung across the back \\nof his horse, his sword in a gloved hand. \\n\"The brother,\" said the man with the grey stubbly face. \\nPage 268\\n\\n\"He\\'s a fierce one, he is,\" mocked the short woman. Hali, they called her. \"You mean to fight us, boy?\" \\n\"Don\\'t be a fool, lad. You\\'re one against six.\" The tall woman, Osha, leveled her spear. \"Off the horse, \\nand throw down the sword. We\\'ll thank you kindly for the mount and for the venison, and you and your \\nbrother can be on your way.\" \\nRobb whistled. They heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet leaves. The undergrowth parted, \\nlow-hanging branches giving up their accumulation of snow, and Grey Wind and Summer emerged from \\nthe green. Summer sniffed the air and growled. \\n\"Wolves,\" gasped Hali. \\n\"Direwolves,\" Bran said. Still half-grown, they were as large as any wolf he had ever seen, but the \\ndifferences were easy to spot, if you knew what to look for. Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster \\nhad taught him. A direwolf had a bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body, and its snout and \\njaw were markedly leaner and more pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrible about them as \\nthey stood there amid the gently falling snow. Fresh blood spotted Grey Wind\\'s muzzle. \\n\"Dogs,\" the big bald man said contemptuously. \"Yet I\\'m told there\\'s nothing like a wolfskin cloak to \\nwarm a man by night.\" He made a sharp gesture. \"Take them.\" \\nRobb shouted, \"Winterfell!\" and kicked his horse. The gelding \\nplunged down the bank as the ragged men closed. A man with an axe rushed in, shouting and heedless. \\nRobb\\'s sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a spray of bright blood. The man \\nwith the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the reins, and for half a second he had them . . . and then \\nGrey Wind was on him, bearing him down. He fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout, flailing \\nwildly with his knife as his head went under. The direwolf plunged in after him, and the white water turned \\nred where they had vanished. \\nRobb and Osha matched blows in midstream. Her long spear was a steel-headed serpent, flashing out at \\nhis chest, once, twice, three times, but Robb parried every thrust with his longsword, turning the point \\naside. On the fourth or fifth thrust, the tall woman overextended herself and lost her balance, just for a \\nsecond. Robb charged, riding her down. \\nA few feet away, Summer darted in and snapped at Hali. The knife bit at his flank. Summer slid away, \\nsnarling, and came rushing in again. This time his jaws closed around her calf. Holding the knife with both \\nhands, the small woman stabbed down, but the direwolf seemed to sense the blade coming. He pulled \\nfree for an instant, his mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh. When Hali stumbled and fell, he \\ncame at her again, slamming her backward, teeth tearing at her belly. \\nThe sixth man ran from the carnage . . . but not far. As he went scrambling up the far side of the bank, \\nGrey Wind emerged from the stream, dripping wet. He shook the water off and bounded after the \\nrunning man, hamstringing him with a single snap of his teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming \\nman slid back down toward the water. \\nAnd then there was no one left but the big man, Stiv. He slashed at Bran\\'s chest strap, grabbed his arm, \\nand yanked. Suddenly Bran was falling. He sprawled on the ground, his legs tangled under him, one foot \\nPage 269\\n\\nin the stream. He could not feel the cold of the water, but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to \\nhis throat. \"Back away,\" the man warned, \"or I\\'ll open the boy\\'s windpipe, I swear it.\" \\nRobb reined his horse in, breathing hard. The fury went out of his eyes, and his sword arm dropped. \\nIn that moment Bran saw everything. Summer was savaging Hali, pulling glistening blue snakes from her \\nbelly. Her eyes were wide and staring. Bran could not tell whether she was alive or dead. The grey \\nstubbly man and the one with the axe lay unmoving, but Osha was on her knees, crawling toward her \\nfallen spear. Grey Wind padded toward her, dripping wet. \"Call him off!\" the big man shouted. \"Call \\nthem both off, or the cripple boy dies now!\" \\n\"Grey Wind, Summer, to me,\" Robb said. \\nThe direwolves stopped, turned their heads. Grey Wind loped back to Robb. Summer stayed where he \\nwas, his eyes on Bran and the man beside him. He growled. His muzzle was wet and red, but his eyes \\nburned. \\nOsha used the butt end of her spear to lever herself back to her feet. Blood leaked from a wound on the \\nupper arm where Robb had cut her. Bran could see sweat trickling down the big man\\'s face. Stiv was as \\nscared as he was, he realized. \"Starks,\" the man muttered, \"bloody Starks.\" He raised his voice. \"Osha, \\nkill the wolves and get his sword.\" \\n\"Kill them yourself,\" she replied. \"I\\'ll not be getting near those monsters.\" \\nFor a moment Stiv was at a loss. His hand trembled; Bran felt a trickle of blood where the knife pressed \\nagainst his neck. The stench of the man filled his nose; he smelled of fear. \"You,\" he called out to Robb. \\n\"You have a name?\" \\n\"I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell.\" \\n\"This is your brother?\" \\n\"Yes.,, \\n\"You want him alive, you do what I say. Off the horse.\" \\nRobb hesitated a moment. Then, slowly and deliberately, he dismounted and stood with his sword in \\nhand. \\n\"Now kill the wolves.\" \\nRobb did not move. \\n\"You do it. The wolves or the boy.\" \\n\"No!\" Bran screamed. If Robb did as they asked, Stiv would kill them both anyway, once the \\ndirewolves were dead. \\nThe bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, till Bran sobbed in pain. \"You \\nPage 270\\n\\nshut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?\" He twisted harder. \"You hear me?\" \\nA low thrum came from the woods behind them. Stiv gave a choked gasp as a half foot of razor-tipped \\nbroadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest. The arrow was bright red, as if it had been painted in \\nblood. \\nThe dagger fell away from Bran\\'s throat. The big man swayed and collapsed, facedown in the stream. \\nThe arrow broke beneath him. Bran watched his life go swirling off in the water. \\nOsha glanced around as Father\\'s guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees, steel in hand. She threw \\ndown her spear. \"Mercy, m\\'lord,\" she called to Robb. \\nThe guardsmen had a strange, pale look to their faces as they took in the scene of slaughter. They eyed \\nthe wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to Hali\\'s corpse to feed, Joseth dropped his knife \\nand scrambled for the bush, heaving. Even Maester Luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind \\na tree, but only for an instant. Then he shook his head and waded across the stream to Bran\\'s side. \"Are \\nyou hurt?\" \\n\"He cut my leg,\" Bran said, \"but I couldn\\'t feel it.\" \\nAs the maester knelt to examine the wound, Bran turned his head. Theon Greyjoy stood beside a \\nsentinel tree, his bow in hand. He was smiling. Ever smiling. A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft \\nground at his feet, but it had taken only one. \"A dead enemy is a thing of beauty,\" he announced. \\n\"Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy,\" Robb said loudly. \"I ought to chain you up in the yard and \\nlet Bran take a few practice shots at you. \" \\n\"You should be thanking me for saving your brother\\'s life.\" \\n\"What if you had missed the shot?\" Robb said. \"What if you\\'d only wounded him? What if you had made \\nhis hand jump, or hit Bran instead? For all you knew, the man might have been wearing a breastplate, all \\nyou could see was the back of his cloak. What would have happened to my brother then? Did you ever \\nthink of that, Greyjoy?\" \\nTheon\\'s smile was gone. He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows from the ground, one by \\none. \\nRobb glared at his guardsmen. \"Where were you?\" he demanded of them. \"I was sure you were close \\nbehind us.\" \\nThe men traded unhappy glances. \"We were following, m\\'lord,\" said Quent, the youngest of them, his \\nbeard a soft brown fuzz. \"Only first we waited for Maester Luwin and his ass, begging your pardons, and \\nthen, well, as it were He glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed. \\n\"I spied a turkey,\" Theon said, annoyed by the question. \"How was I to know that you\\'d leave the boy \\nalone?\" \\nRobb turned his head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen him so angry, yet he said \\nPage 271\\n\\nnothing. Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin. \"How badly is my brother wounded?\" \\n\"No more than a scratch,\" the maester said. He wet a cloth in the stream to clean the cut. \"Two of them \\nwear the black,\" he told Robb as he worked. \\nRobb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, his ragged black cloak moving fitfully as the \\nrushing waters tugged at it. \"Deserters from the Night\\'s Watch,\" he said grimly. \"They must have been \\nfools, to come so close to Winterfell.\" \\n\"Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart,\" said Maester Luwin. \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 359 \\n\"Shall we bury them, m\\'lord?\" asked Quent. \\n\"They would not have buried us,\" Robb said. \"Hack off their heads, we\\'ll send them back to the Wall. \\nLeave the rest for the carrion crows.\" \\n\"And this one?\" Quent jerked a thumb toward Osha. \\nRobb walked over to her. She was a head taller than he was, but she dropped to her knees at his \\napproach. \"Give me my life, m1ord of Stark, and I am yours.\" \\n\"Mine? What would I do with an oathbreaker?\" \\n\"I broke no oaths. Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall, not me. The black crows got no place for \\nwomen.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy sauntered closer. \"Give her to the wolves,\" he urged Robb. The woman\\'s eyes went to \\nwhat was left of Hali, and just as quickly away. She shuddered. Even the guardsmen looked queasy. \\n\"She\\'s a woman,\" Robb said. \\n\"A wildling,\" Bran told him. \"She said they should keep me alive so they could take me to Mance \\nRayder.\" \\n\"Do you have a name?\" Robb asked her. \\n\"Osha, as it please the lord,\" she muttered sourly. \\nMaester Luwin stood. \"We might do well to question her.\" \\nBran could see the relief on his brother\\'s face. \"As you say, Maester. Wayn, bind her hands. She\\'ll come \\nback to Winterfell with us . . . and live or die by the truths she gives us.\" \\nTYRION \\n\"Yu want eat?\" Mord asked, glowering. He had a plate of oiled beans in one thick, stub-fingered hand. \\nPage 272\\n\\nTyrion Lannister was starved, but he refused to let this brute see him cringe. \"A leg of lamb would be \\npleasant,\" he said, from the heap of soiled straw in the corner of his cell. \"Perhaps a dish of peas and \\nonions, some fresh baked bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down. Or beer, if \\nthat\\'s easier. I try not to be overly particular.\" \\n\"Is beans,\" Mord said. \"Here.\" He held out the plate. \\nTyrion sighed. The turnkey was twenty stone of gross stupidity, with brown rotting teeth and small dark \\neyes. The left side of his face was slick with scar where an axe had cut off his ear and part of his cheek. \\nHe was as predictable as he was ugly, but Tyrion was hungry. He reached up for the plate. \\nMord jerked it away, grinning. \"Is here,\" he said, holding it out beyond Tyrion\\'s reach. \\nThe dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet, every joint aching. \"Must we play the same fool\\'s game with every \\nmeal?\" He made another grab for the beans. \\nMord shambled backward, grinning through his rotten teeth. \"Is here, dwarf man.\" He held the plate out \\nat arm\\'s length, over the edge \\nwhere the cell ended and the sky began. \"You not want eat? Here. Come take.\" \\nTyrion\\'s arms were too short to reach the plate, and he was not about to step that close to the edge. All \\nit would take would be a quick shove of Mord\\'s heavy white belly, and he would end up a sickening red \\nsplotch on the stones of Sky, like so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries. \"Come to think \\non it, I\\'m not hungry after all,\" he declared, retreating to the corner of his cell. \\nMord grunted and opened his thick fingers. The wind took the plate, flipping it over as it fell. A handful \\nof beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of sight. The turnkey laughed, his gut shaking like \\na bowl of pudding. \\nTyrion felt a pang of rage. \"You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass,\" he spat. \"I hope you die of a bloody \\nflux.\" \\nFor that, Mord gave him a kick, driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion\\'s ribs on the way out. \"I take \\nit back!\" he gasped as he doubled over on the straw. \"I\\'ll kill you myself, I swear it!\" The heavy \\nironbound door slammed shut. Tyrion heard the rattle of keys. \\nFor a small man, he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth, he reflected as he crawled back to \\nhis corner of what the Arryns laughably called their dungeon. He huddled beneath the thin blanket that \\nwas his only bedding, staring out at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on \\nforever, wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak he\\'d won from Marillion at dice, after the singer had \\nstolen it off the body of that brigand chief. The skin had smelled of blood and mold, but it was warm and \\nthick. Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on it. \\nThe wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons. His cell was miserably small, even for a dwarf. \\nNot five feet away, where a wall ought to have been, where a wall would be in a proper dungeon, the \\nfloor ended and the sky began. He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and the moon and stars by night, \\nbut Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest, gloomiest pit in the bowels of the \\nCasterly Rock. \\nPage 273\\n\\n\"You fly,\" Mord had promised him, when he\\'d shoved him into the cell. \"Twenty day, thirty, fifty maybe. \\nThen you fly.\" \\nThe Arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were welcome to escape at will. \\nThat first day, after girding up his courage for hours, Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to \\nthe edge, to poke out his head and look down. Sky was six hundred feet below, with nothing between \\nbut empty air. If he craned his neck out as far as it could go, he could see other cells to his right and left \\nand \\nabove him. He was a bee in a stone honeycomb, and someone had torn off his wings. \\nIt was cold in the cell, the wind screamed night and day, and worst of all, the floor sloped. Ever so \\nslightly, yet it was enough. He was afraid to close his eyes, afraid that he might roll over in his steep and \\nwake in sudden terror as he went sliding off the edge. Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad. \\nGods save me, some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that looked suspiciously like \\nblood, the blue is calling. At first Tyrion wondered who he\\'d been, and what had become of him; later, he \\ndecided that he would rather not know. \\nIf only he had shut his mouth . . . \\nThe wretched boy had started it, looking down on him from a throne of carved weirwood beneath the \\nmoon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn. Tyrion Lannister had been looked down on all his life, but \\nseldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to \\nthe height of a man. \"Is he the bad man?\" the boy had asked, clutching his doll. \\n\"He is,\" the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him. She was all in blue, powdered and \\nperfumed for the suitors who filled her court. \\n\"He\\'s so small,\" the Lord of the Eyrie said, giggling. \\n\"This is Tyrion the Imp, of House Lannister, who murdered your father.\" She raised her voice so it \\ncarried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie, ringing off the milk-white walls and the slender pillars, \\nso every man could hear it. \"He slew the Hand of the King!\" \\n\"Oh, did I kill him too?\" Tyrion had said, like a fool. \\nThat would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his head bowed. He could \\nsee that now; seven hells, he had seen it then. The High Hall of the Arryns was long and austere, with a \\nforbidding coldness to its walls of blue-veined white marble, but the faces around him had been colder by \\nfar. The power of Casterly Rock was far away, and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale of \\nArryn. Submission and silence would have been his best defenses. \\nBut Tyrion\\'s mood had been too foul for sense. To his shame, he had faltered during the last leg of their \\nday-long climb up to the Eyrie, his stunted legs unable to take him any higher. Brorm had carried him the \\nrest of the way, and the humiliation poured oil on the flames of his anger. \"It would seem I\\'ve been a busy \\nlittle fellow,\" he said with bitter sarcasm. \"I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying and \\nmurdering.\" \\nPage 274\\n\\nHe ought to have remembered who he was dealing with. Lysa Arryn \\nand her half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit, especially when it was \\ndirected at them. \\n\"Imp,\" Lysa said coldly, \"you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and speak to my son politely, or I \\npromise you will have cause to regret it. Remember where you are. This is the Eyrie, and these are \\nknights of the Vale you see around you, true men who loved Jon Arryn well. Every one of them would \\ndie for me.\" \\n\"Lady Arryn, should any harm come to me, my brother Jaime will be pleased to see that they do.\" Even \\nas he spat out the words, Tyrion knew they were folly. \\n\"Can you fly, my lord of Lannister?\" Lady Lysa asked. \"Does a dwarf have wings? If not, you would be \\nwiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind.\" \\n\"I made no threats,\" Tyrion said. \"That was a promise.\" \\nLittle Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that, so upset he dropped his doll. \"You can\\'t hurt us,\" he \\nscreamed. \"No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mother, tell him he can\\'t hurt us here.\" The boy began to \\ntwitch. \\n\"The Eyrie is impregnable,\" Lysa Arryn declared calmly. She drew her son close, holding him safe in the \\ncircle of her plump white arms. \"The Imp is trying to frighten us, sweet baby. The Lannisters are all liars. \\nNo one will hurt my sweet boy.\" \\nThe hell of it was, she was no doubt right. Having seen what it took to get here, Tyrion could well \\nimagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way up in armor, while stones and arrows poured \\ndown from above and enemies contested with him for every step. Nightmare did not begin to describe it. \\nSmall wonder the Eyrie had never been taken. \\nStill, Tyrion had been unable to silence himself. \"Not impregnable,\" he said, \"merely inconvenient.\" \\nYoung Robert pointed down, his hand trembling. \"You\\'re a liar. Mother, I want to see him fly.\" Two \\nguardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms, lifting him off his floor. \\nThe gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn Stark. \"Sister,\" she called \\nout from where she stood below the thrones, \"I beg you to remember, this man is my prisoner. I will not \\nhave him harmed.\" \\nLysa Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept down on Tyrion, her long \\nskirts trailing after her. For an instant he feared she would strike him, but instead she commanded them to \\nrelease him. Her men shoved him to the floor, his legs went out from under him, and Tyrion fell. \\nHe must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees, only to feel his right leg spasm, sending him \\nsprawling once more. Laughter boomed up and down the High Hall of the Arryns. \\nPage 275\\n\\n\"My sister\\'s little guest is too weary to stand,\" Lady Lysa announced. \"Ser Vardis, take him down to the \\ndungeon. A rest in one of our sky cells will do him much good.\" \\nThe guardsmen jerked him upright. Tyrion Lannister dangled between them, kicking feebly, his face red \\nwith shame. \"I will remember this,\" he told them all as they carried him off. \\nAnd so he did, for all the good it did him. \\nAt first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long. Lysa Arryn wanted to humble \\nhim, that was all. She would send for him again, and soon. If not her, then Catelyn Stark would want to \\nquestion him. This time he would guard his tongue more closely. They dare not kill him out of hand; he \\nwas still a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and if they shed his blood, it would mean war. Or so he had told \\nhimself. \\nNow he was not so certain. \\nPerhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here, but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for \\nlong. He was growing weaker every day, and it was only a matter of time until Mord\\'s kicks and blows \\ndid him serious harm, provided the gaoler did not starve him to death first. A few more nights of cold and \\nhunger, and the blue would start calling to him too. \\nHe wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of his cell. Lord Tywin would \\nsurely have sent out riders when the word reached him. Jaime might be leading a host through the \\nMountains of the Moon even now . . . unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead. Did anyone \\noutside the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what Cersei would do \\nwhen she heard. The king could order him freed, but would Robert listen to his queen or his Hand? \\nTyrion had no illusions about the king\\'s love for his sister. \\nIf Cersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of Tyrion himself. Even Ned \\nStark could scarcely object to that, not without impugning the honor of the king. And Tyrion would be \\nonly too glad to take his chances in a trial. Whatever murders they might lay at his door, the Starks had \\nno proof of anything so far as he could see. Let them make their case before the Iron Throne and the \\nlords of the land. It would be the end of them. If only Cersei were clever enough to see that . . . \\nTyrion Lannister sighed. His sister was not without a certain low \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 365 \\ncunning, but her pride blinded her. She would see the insult in this, not the opportunity. And Jaime was \\neven worse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never untied a knot when he could \\nslash it in two with his sword. \\nHe wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy, and whether they had truly \\nconspired at the death of Lord Arryn. If the old Hand had been murdered, it was deftly and subtly done. \\nMen of his age died of sudden illness all the time. In contrast, sending some oaf with a stolen knife after \\nBrandon Stark struck him as unbelievably clumsy. And wasn\\'t that peculiar, come to think on it . . . \\nTyrion shivered. Now there was a nasty suspicion. Perhaps the direwolf and the lion were not the only \\nbeasts in the woods, and if that was true, someone was using him as a catspaw. Tyrion Lannister hated \\nbeing used. \\nPage 276\\n\\nHe would have to get out of here, and soon. His chances of overpowering Mord were small to none, \\nand no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-long rope, so he would have to talk himself \\nfree. His mouth had gotten him into this cell; it could damn well get him out. \\nTyrion pushed himself to his feet, doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath him, with its \\never-so-subtle tug toward the edge. He hammered on the door with a fist. \"Mord!\" he shouted. \\n\"Turnkey! Mord, I want you!\" He had to keep it up a good ten minutes before he heard footsteps. Tyrion \\nstepped back an instant before the door opened with a crash. \\n\"Making noise,\" Mord growled, with blood in his eyes. Dangling from one meaty hand was a leather \\nstrap, wide and thick, doubled over in his fist. \\nNever show them You\\'re afraid, Tyrion reminded himself. \"How would you like to be rich?\" he asked. \\nMord hit him. He swung the strap backhand, lazily, but the leather caught Tyrion high on the arm. The \\nforce of it staggered him, and the pain made him grit his teeth. \"No mouth, dwarf man,\" Mord warned \\nhim. \\n\"Gold,\" Tyrion said, miming a smile. \"Casterly Rock is full of gold . . . ahhhh . . .\" This time the blow was \\na forehand, and Mord put more of his arm into the swing, making the leather crack and jump. It caught \\nTyrion in the ribs and dropped him to his knees, wimpering. He forced himself to look up at the gaoler. \\n\"As rich as the Lannisters,\" he wheezed. \"That\\'s what they say, Mord-\" \\nMord grunted. The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in the face. The pain was so \\nbad he did not remember \\nfalling, but when he opened his eyes again he was on the floor of his cell. His ear was ringing, and his \\nmouth was full of blood. He groped for purchase, to push himself up, and his fingers brushed against . . . \\nnothing. Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded, and tried his best to stop \\nbreathing. He had fallen right on the edge, inches from the blue. \\n\"More to say?\" Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull. The snap made Tyrion \\njump. The turnkey laughed. \\nHe won\\'tpush me over, Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away from the edge. Catelyn \\nStark wants me alive, he doesn\\'t dare kill me. He wiped the blood off his lips with the back of his hand, \\ngrinned, and said, \"That was a stiff one, Mord.\" The gaoler squinted at him, trying to decide if he was \\nbeing mocked. \"I could make good use of a strong man like you.\" The strap flew at him, but this time \\nTyrion was able to cringe away from it. He took a glancing blow to the shoulder, nothing more. \"Gold,\" \\nhe repeated, scrambling backward like a crab, ,\\'more gold than you\\'ll see here in a lifetime. Enough to \\nbuy land, women, horses . . . you could be a lord. Lord Mord.\" Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and \\nphlegm and spat it out into the sky. \\n\"Is no gold,\" Mord said. \\nHe\\'s listening! Tyrion thought. \"They relieved me of my purse when they captured me, but the gold is still \\nmine. Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but she\\'d never stoop to rob him. That wouldn\\'t be \\nhonorable. Help me, and all the gold is yours.\" Mord\\'s strap licked out, but it was a halfhearted, \\nPage 277\\n\\ndesultory swing, slow and contemptuous. Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned. \\n\"There will be no risk to you. All you need do is deliver a message.\" \\nThe gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion\\'s grasp. \"Message,\" he said, as if he had never heard \\nthe word before. His frown made deep creases in his brow. \\n\"You heard me, my lord. Only carry my word to your lady. Tell her . . .\" \"at? \"at would possibly make \\nLysa Anyn relent? The inspiration came to Tyrion Lannister suddenly. tell her that I wish to confess my \\ncrimes.\" \\nMord raised his arm and Tyrion braced himself for another blow, but the turnkey hesitated. Suspicion \\nand greed warred in his eyes. He wanted that gold, yet he feared a trick; he had the look of a man who \\nhad often been tricked. \"Is lie,\" he muttered darkly. \"Dwarf man cheat me.,, \\n\"I will put my promise in writing,\" Tyrion vowed. \\nSome illiterates held writing in disdain; others seemed to have a superstitious reverence for the written \\nword, as if it were some sort of \\nA GAML OF THRONLS 367 \\nmagic. Fortunately, Mord was one of the latter. The turnkey lowered the strap. \"Writing down gold. \\nMuch gold.\" \\n\"Oh, much gold,\" Tyrion assured him. \"The purse is just a taste, my friend. My brother wears armor of \\nsolid gold plate.\" In truth, Jaime\\'s armor was gilded steel, but this oaf would never know the difference. \\nMord fingered his strap thoughtfully, but in the end, he relented and went to fetch paper and ink. When \\nthe letter was written, the gaoler frowned at it suspiciously. \"Now deliver my message,\" Tyrion urged. \\nHe was shivering in his sleep when they came for him, late that night. Mord opened the door but kept his \\nsilence. Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of his boot. \"On your feet, Imp. My lady wants to \\nsee you.\" \\nTyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt. \"No doubt she does, but \\nwhat makes you think I wish to see her?\" \\nSer Vardis frowned. Tyrion remembered him well from the years he had spent at King\\'s Landing as the \\ncaptain of the Hand\\'s household guard. A square, plain face, silver hair, a heavy build, and no humor \\nwhatsoever. \"Your wishes are not my concern. On your feet, or I\\'ll have you carried.\" \\nTyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet. \"A cold night,\" he said casually, \"and the High Hall is so drafty. \\nI don\\'t wish to catch a chill. Mord, if you would be so good, fetch my cloak.\" \\nThe gaoler squinted at him, face dull with suspicion. \\n\"My cloak,\" Tyrion repeated. \"The shadowskin you took from me for safekeeping. You recall.\" \\n\"Get him the damnable cloak,\" Ser Vardis said. \\nMord did not dare grumble. He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future retribution, yet he went for the \\nPage 278\\n\\ncloak. When he draped it around his prisoner\\'s neck, Tyrion smiled. \"My thanks. I shall think of you \\nwhenever I wear it.\" He flung the trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder, and felt warm for the \\nfirst time in days. \"Lead on, Ser Vardis.\" \\nThe High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches, burning in the sconces along the \\nwalls. The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-falcon sewn on her breast in pearls. Since she \\ndid not look the sort to join the Night\\'s Watch, Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning \\nclothes were appropriate garb for a confession. Her long auburn hair, woven into an elaborate braid, fell \\nacross her left shoulder. The taller throne beside her was \\nempty; no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in his sleep. Tyrion was thankful for that \\nmuch, at least. \\nHe bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall. Lady Arryn had summoned her knights \\nand retainers to hear his confession, as he had hoped. He saw Ser Brynden Tully\\'s craggy face and Lord \\nNestor Royce\\'s bluff one. Beside Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black side-whiskers who \\ncould only be his heir, Ser Albar. Most of the principal houses of the Vale were represented. Tyrion \\nnoted Ser Lyn Corbray, slender as a sword, Lord Hunter with his gouty legs, the widowed Lady \\nWaynwood surrounded by her sons. Others sported sigils he did not know; broken lance, green viper, \\nburning tower, winged chalice. \\nAmong the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high road; Ser Rodrik Cassel, \\npale from half-healed wounds, stood with Ser Willis Wode beside him. Marillion the singer had found a \\nnew woodharp. Tyrion smiled; whatever happened here tonight, he did not wish it to happen in secret, \\nand there was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far. \\nIn the rear of the hall, Bronn lounged beneath a pillar. The freerider\\'s black eyes were fixed on Tyrion, \\nand his hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword. Tyrion gave him a long look, wondering . . . \\nCatelyn Stark spoke first. \"You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.\" \\n\"I do, my lady,\" Tyrion answered. \\nLysa Arryn smiled at her sister. \"The sky cells always break them. The gods can see them there, and \\nthere is no darkness to hide in.\" \\n\"He does not look broken to me,\" Lady Catelyn said. \\nLady Lysa paid her no mind. \"Say what you will,\" she commanded Tyrion. \\nAnd now to roll the dice, he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn. \"Where to begin? I am a \\nvile little man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting, my lords and ladies. I have lain with \\nwhores, not once but hundreds of times. I have wished my own lord father dead, and my sister, our \\ngracious queen, as well.\" Behind him, someone chuckled. \"I have not always treated my servants with \\nkindness. I have gambled. I have even cheated, I blush to admit. I have said many cruel and malicious \\nthings about the noble lords and ladies of the court.\" That drew outright laughter. \"Once I-\" \\n\"Silence!\" Lysa Arryn\\'s pale round face had turned a burning pink. \"What do you imagine you are doing, \\ndwarf?\" \\nPage 279\\n\\nTyrion cocked his head to one side. \"Why, confessing my crimes, my lady-\" \\nCatelyn Stark took a step forward. \"You are accused of sending a hired knife to slay my son Bran in his \\nbed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.\" \\nTyrion gave a helpless shrug. \"Those crimes I cannot confess, I fear. I know nothing of any murders.\" \\nLady Lysa rose from her weirwood throne. \"I will not be made mock of. You have had your little jape, \\nImp. I trust you enjoyed it. Ser Vardis, take him back to the dungeon . . . but this time find him a smaller \\ncell, with a floor more sharply sloped.\" \\n\"Is this how justice is done in the Vale?\" Tyrion roared, so loudly that Ser Vardis froze for an instant. \\n\"Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate? You accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into an \\nopen cell to freeze and starve.\" He lifted his head, to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had \\nleft on his face. \"Where is the king\\'s justice? Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms? I stand \\naccused, you say. Very well. I demand a ttial! Let me speak, and let my truth or falsehood be judged \\nopenly, in the sight of gods and men.\" \\nA low murmuring filled the High Hall. He had her, Tyrion knew. He was highborn, the son of the most \\npowerful lord in the realm, the brother of the queen. He could not be denied a trial. Guardsmen in \\nsky-blue cloaks had started toward Tyrion, but Ser Vardis bid them halt and looked to Lady Lysa. \\nHer small mouth twitched in a petulant smile. \"If you are tried and found to be guilty of the crimes for \\nwhich you stand accused, then by the king\\'s own laws, you must pay with your life\\'s blood. We keep no \\nheadsman in the Eyrie, my lord of Lannister. Open the Moon Door.\" \\nThe press of spectators parted. A narrow weirwood door stood between two slender marble pillars, a \\ncrescent moon carved in the white wood. Those standing closest edged backward as a pair of \\nguardsmen marched through. One man removed the heavy bronze bars; the second pulled the door \\ninward. Their blue cloaks rose snapping from their shoulders, caught in the sudden gust of wind that came \\nhowling through the open door. Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky, speckled with cold uncaring \\nstars. \\n\"Behold the king\\'s justice,\" Lysa Arryn said. Torch flames fluttered like permons along the walls, and \\nhere and there the odd torch guttered out. \\n\"Lysa, I think this unwise,\" Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled around the hall. \\nHer sister ignored her. \"You want a trial, my lord of Lannister. Very well, a trial you shall have. My son \\nwill listen to whatever you care to \\nsay, and you shall hear his judgment. Then you may leave ... by one door or the other.\" \\nShe looked so pleased with herself, Tyrion thought, and small wonder. How could a trial threaten her, \\nwhen her weakling son was the lord judge? Tyrion glanced at her Moon Door. Mother, I want to see him \\nfly! the boy had said. How many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already? \\nPage 280\\n\\n\" I thank you, my good lady, but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert,\" Tyrion said politely. \"The gods \\nknow the truth of my innocence. I will have their verdict, not the judgment of men. I demand trial by \\ncombat.\" \\nA storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns. Lord Nestor Royce snorted, Ser Willis \\nchuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw back their heads and howled until tears ran \\ndown their faces. Marillion clumsily plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his \\nbroken hand. Even the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon Door. \\nLysa Arryn\\'s watery blue eyes looked uncertain. He had caught her off balance. \"You have that right, to \\nbe sure.\" \\nThe young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped forward and went to one \\nknee. \"My lady, I beg the boon of championing your cause.\" \\n\"The honor should be mine,\" old Lord Hunter said. \"For the love I bore your lord husband, let me \\navenge his death.\" \\n\"My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,\" Ser Albar Royce boomed. \"Let me \\nserve his son in this.\" \\n\"The gods favor the man with the just cause,\" said Ser Lyn Corbray, \"yet often that turns out to be the \\nman with the surest sword. We all know who that is.\" He smiled modestly. \\nA dozen other men all spoke at once, clamoring to be heard. Tyrion found it disheartening to realize so \\nmany strangers were eager to kill him. Perhaps this had not been such a clever plan after all. \\nLady Lysa raised a hand for silence. \"I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if he \\nwere among us. No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold and true as the knights of the Vale. Would \\nthat I could grant you all this honor. Yet I can choose only one.\" She gestured. \"Ser Vardis Egen, you \\nwere ever my lord husband\\'s good right hand. You shall be our champion.\" \\nSer Vardis had been singularly silent. \"My lady,\" he said gravely, sinking to one knee, \"pray give this \\nburden to another, I have no taste for it. The man is no warrior. Look at him. A dwarf, half my size and \\nlame in the legs. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.\" \\nOh, excellent, Tyrion thought. \"I agree.\" \\nLysa glared at him. \"You demanded a trial by combat.\" \\n\"And now I demand a champion, such as you have chosen for yourself. My brother Jaime will gladly \\ntake my part, I know.\" \\n\"Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here,\" snapped Lysa Arryn. \\n\"Send a bird for him. I will gladly await his arrival.\" \\nPage 281\\n\\n\"You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow.\" \\n\"Singer,\" Tyrion said, turning to Marillion, \"when you make a ballad of this, be certain you tell them how \\nLady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling \\nto face her finest knight.\" \\n\"I deny you nothing!\" Lysa Arryn said, her voice peeved and shrill with irritation. \"Name your champion, \\nImp . . . if you think you can find a man to die for you.\" \\n\"If it is all the same to you, I\\'d sooner find one to kill for me.\" Tyrion looked over the long hall. No one \\nmoved. For a long moment he wondered if it had all been a colossal blunder. \\nThen there was a stirring in the rear of the chamber. \"I\\'ll stand for the dwarf,\" Bronn called out. \\nEDDARD \\nHe dreamt an old dream, of three knights in white cloaks, and a tower long fallen, and Lyanna in her bed \\nof blood. \\nIn the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. Proud Martyn Cassel, Jory\\'s father; faithful \\nTheo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been Brandon\\'s squire; Ser Mark Ryswell, soft of speech and gentle \\nof heart; the crannogman, Howland Reed; Lord Dustin on his great red stallion. Ned had known their \\nfaces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man\\'s memories, even those he has \\nvowed never to forget. In the dream they were only shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist. \\nThey were seven, facing three. In the dream as it had been in life. Yet these were no ordinary three. \\nThey waited before the round tower, the red mountains of Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks \\nblowing in the wind. And these were no shadows; their faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, \\nthe Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over \\nhis right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade with a whetstone. Across his \\nwhite-enameled helm, the black bat of his House spread its wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser \\nGerold Hightower, the White Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. \\n\"I looked for you on the Trident,\" Ned said to them. \\n\"We were not there,\" Ser Gerold answered. \\n\"Woe to the Usurper if we had been,\" said Ser Oswell. \\n\"When King\\'s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you \\nwere.\" \\n\"Far away,\" Ser Gerold said, \"or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn \\nin seven hells.\" \\n\"I came down on Storm\\'s End to lift the siege,\" Ned told them, .,and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne \\ndipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be \\nPage 282\\n\\namong them.\" \\n\"Our knees do not bend easily,\" said Ser Arthur Dayne. \\n\"Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have \\nsailed with him.\" \\n\"Ser Willem is a good man and true,\" said Ser Oswell. \\n\"But not of the Kingsguard,\" Ser Gerold pointed out. \"The Kingsguard does not flee.\" \\n\"Then or now,\" said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm. \\n\"We swore a vow,\" explained old Ser Gerold. \\nNed\\'s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were seven against three. \\n\"And now it begins,\" said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held \\nit with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light. \\n\"No,\" Ned said with sadness in his voice. \"Now it ends.\" As they came together in a rush of steel and \\nshadow, he could hear Lyanna screaming. \"Eddard!\" she called. A storm of rose petals blew across a \\nblood-streaked sky, as blue as the eyes of death. \\n\"Lord Eddard,\" Lyanna called again. \\n\"I promise,\" he whispered. \"Lya, I promise \\n\"Lord Eddard,\" a man echoed from the dark. \\nGroaning, Eddard Stark opened his eyes. Moonlight streamed through the tall windows of the Tower of \\nthe Hand. \\n\"Lord Eddard?\" A shadow stood over the bed. \\n\"How . . . how long?\" The sheets were tangled, his leg splinted and plastered. A dull throb of pain shot \\nup his side. \\n\"Six days and seven nights.\" The voice was Vayon Poole\\'s. The steward held a cup to Ned\\'s lips. \\n\"Drink, my lord.\" \\n,,what . . . T\\' \\n\"Only water. Maester Pycelle said you would be thirsty.\" \\nNed drank. His lips were parched and cracked. The water tasted sweet as honey. \\n\"The king left orders,\" Vayon Poole told him when the cup was empty. \"He would speak with you, my \\nlord.\" \\n374 GLORGE R.R. MARTIN \\nPage 283\\n\\n\"On the morrow,\" Ned said. \"When I am stronger.\" He could not face Robert now. The dream had left \\nhim weak as a kitten. \\n\"My lord,\" Poole said, \"he commanded us to send you to him the moment you opened your eyes.\" The \\nsteward busied himself lighting a bedside candle. \\nNed cursed softly. Robert was never known for his patience. \"Tell him I\\'m too weak to come to him. If \\nhe wishes to speak with me, I should be pleased to receive him here. I hope you wake him from a sound \\nsleep. And summon . . .\" He was about to say Jory when he remembered. \"Summon the captain of my \\nguard.\" \\nAlyn stepped into the bedchamber a few moments after the steward had taken his leave. \"My lord.\" \\n\"Poole tells me it has been six days,\" Ned said. \"I must know how things stand.\" \\n\"The Kingslayer is fled the city,\" Alyn told him. \"The talk is he\\'s ridden back to Casterly Rock to join his \\nfather. The story of how Lady Catelyn took the Imp is on every lip. I have put on extra guards, if it \\nplease you.\" \\n\"It does,\" Ned assured him. \"My daughters?\" \\n\"They have been with you every day, my lord. Sansa prays quietly, but Arya . . .\" He hesitated. \"She has \\nnot said a word since they brought you back. She is a fierce little thing, my lord. I have never seen such \\nanger in a girl.\" \\n\"Whatever happens,\" Ned said, \"I want my daughters kept safe. I fear this is only the beginning.\" \\n\"No harm will come to them, Lord Eddard,\" Alyn said. \"I stake my life on that.\" \\n:,Jory and the others \\nJ gave them over to the silent sisters, to be sent north to Winterfell. Jory would want to lie beside his \\ngrandfather.\" \\nIt would have to be his grandfather, for Jory\\'s father was buried far to the south. Martyn Cassel had \\nperished with the rest. Ned had pulled the tower down afterward, and used its bloody stones to build \\neight cairns upon the ridge. It was said that Rhaegar had named that place the tower of joy, but for Ned \\nit was a bitter memory. They had been seven against three, yet only two had lived to ride away; Eddard \\nStark himself and the little crannogman, Howland Reed. He did not think it omened well that he should \\ndream that dream again after so many years. \\n\"You\\'ve done well, Alyn,\" Ned was saying when Vayon Poole returned. The steward bowed low. \"His \\nGrace is without, my lord, and the queen with him.\" \\nNed pushed himself up higher, wincing as his leg trembled with pain. He had not expected Cersei to \\ncome. It did not bode well that she had. \"Send them in, and leave us. What we have to say should not go \\nbeyond these walls.\" Poole withdrew quietly. \\nPage 284\\n\\nRobert had taken time to dress. He wore a black velvet doublet with the crowned stag of Baratheon \\nworked upon the breast in golden thread, and a golden mantle with a cloak of black and gold squares. A \\nflagon of wine was in his hand, his face already flushed from drink. Cersei Lannister entered behind him, \\na jeweled tiara in her hair. \\n\"Your Grace,\" Ned said. \"Your pardons. I cannot rise.\" \\n\"No matter,\" the king said gruffly. \"Some wine? From the Arbor. A good vintage.\" \\n\"A small cup,\" Ned said. \"My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy.\" \\n\"A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on his shoulders,\" the queen \\ndeclared. \\n\"Quiet, woman,\" Robert snapped. He brought Ned a cup of wine. \"Does the leg still pain you?\" \\n\"Some,\" Ned said. His head was swimming, but it would not do to admit to weakness in front of the \\nqueen. \\n\"Pycelle swears it will heal clean.\" Robert frowned. \"I take it you know what Catelyn has done?\" \\n\"I do.\" Ned took a small swallow of wine. \"My lady wife is blameless, Your Grace. All she did she did \\nat my command.\" \\n\"I am not pleased, Ned,\" Robert grumbled. \\n\"By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood?\" Cersei demanded. \"Who do you think you are?\" \\n\"The Hand of the King,\" Ned told her with icy courtesy. \"Charged by your own lord husband to keep \\nthe king\\'s peace and enforce the king\\'s justice.\" \\n\"You were the Hand,\" Cersei began, \"but now-\" \\n\"Silence!\" the king roared. \"You asked him a question and he answered it.\" Cersei subsided, cold with \\nanger, and Robert turned back to Ned. \"Keep the king\\'s peace, you say. Is this how you keep my \\npeace, Ned? Seven men are dead . . .\" \\n\"Eight,\" the queen corrected. \"Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord Stark gave him.\" \\n\"Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets,\" the king said. \"I will not have it, \\nNed.\" \\n\"Catelyn had good reason for taking the Irnp-\" \\n\"I said, I will not have it! To hell with her reasons. You will command \\nher to release the dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.\" \\n\"Three of my men were butchered before my eyes, because Jaime Lannister wished to chasten me. Am I \\nPage 285\\n\\nto forget that?\" \\n\"My brother was not the cause of this quarrel,\" Cersei told the king. \"Lord Stark was returning drunk \\nfrom a brothel. His men attacked Jaime and his guards, even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the \\nkingsroad.\" \\n\"You know me better than that, Robert,\" Ned said. \"Ask Lord Baelish if you doubt me. He was there.\" \\n\"I\\'ve talked to Littlefinger,\" Robert said. \"He claims he rode off to bring the gold cloaks before the \\nfighting began, but he admits you were returning from some whorehouse.\" \\n\"Some whorehouse? Damn your eyes, Robert, I went there to have a look at your daughter! Her mother \\nhas named her Barra. She looks like that first girl you fathered, when we were boys together in the Vale.\" \\nHe watched the queen as he spoke; her face was a mask, still and pale, betraying nothing. \\nRobert flushed. \"Barra,\" he grumbled. \"Is that supposed to please me? Damn the girl. I thought she had \\nmore sense.\" \\n\"She cannot be more than fifteen, and a whore, and you thought she had sense?\" Ned said, incredulous. \\nHis leg was beginning to pain him sorely. It was hard to keep his temper. \"The fool child is in love with \\nyou, Robert.\" \\nThe king glanced at Cersei. \"This is no fit subject for the queen\\'s ears.\" \\n\"Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say,\" Ned replied. \"I am told the Kingslayer has fled \\nthe city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.\" \\nThe king swirled the wine in his cup, brooding. He took a swallow. \"No,\" he said. \"I want no more of \\nthis. Jaime slew three of your men, and you five of his. Now it ends.\" \\n\"Is that your notion of justice?\" Ned flared. \"If so, I am pleased that I am no longer your Hand.\" \\nThe queen looked to her husband. \"If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen as he has spoken to \\nyou-\" \\n\"Do you take me for Aerys?\" Robert interrupted. \\n\"I took you for a king. Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers, by all the laws of marriage and the \\nbonds we share. The Starks have driven off the one and seized the other. This man dishonors you with \\nevery breath he takes, and yet you stand there meekly, asking if his leg pains him and would he like some \\nwine.\" \\nRobert\\'s face was dark with anger. \"How many times must I tell you to hold your tongue, woman?\" \\nCersei\\'s face was a study in contempt. \"What a jape the gods have made of us two,\" she said. \"By all \\nrights, you ought to be in skirts and me in mail.\" \\nPurple with rage, the king lashed out, a vicious backhand blow to the side of the head. She stumbled \\nagainst the table and fell hard, yet Cersei Lannister did not cry out. Her slender fingers brushed her \\nPage 286\\n\\ncheek, where the pale smooth skin was already reddening. On the morrow the bruise would cover half \\nher face. \"I shall wear this as a badge of honor,\" she announced. \\n\"Wear it in silence, or I\\'ll honor you again,\" Robert vowed. He shouted for a guard. Ser Meryn Trant \\nstepped into the room, tall and somber in his white armor. \"The queen is tired. See her to her \\nbedchamber.\" The knight helped Cersei to her feet and led her out without a word. \\nRobert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup. \"You see what she does to me, Ned.\" The king seated \\nhimself, cradling his wine cup. \"My loving wife. The mother of my children.\" The rage was gone from him \\nnow; in his eyes Ned saw something sad and scared. \"I should not have hit her. That was not . . . that \\nwas not kingly.\" He stared down at his hands, as if he did not quite know what they were. \"I was always \\nstrong . . . no one could stand before me, no one. How do you fight someone if you can\\'t hit them?\" \\nConfused, the king shook his head. \"Rhaegar . . . Rhaegar won, damn him. I killed him, Ned, I drove the \\nspike right through that black armor into his black heart, and he died at my feet. They made up songs \\nabout it. Yet somehow he still won. He has Lyanna now, and I have her.\" The king drained his cup. \\n\"Your Grace,\" Ned Stark said, \"we must talk . . .\" \\nRobert pressed his fingertips against his temples. \"I am sick unto death of talk. On the morrow I\\'m going \\nto the kingswood to hunt. Whatever you have to say can wait until I return.\" \\n\"If the gods are good, I shall not be here on your return. You commanded me to return to Winterfell, \\nremember?\" \\nRobert stood up, grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself. \"The gods are seldom good, Ned. \\nHere, this is yours.\" He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and \\ntossed it on the bed. \"Like it or not, you are my Hand, damn you. I forbid you to leave.\" \\nNed picked up the silver clasp. He was being given no choice, it seemed. His leg throbbed, and he felt \\nas helpless as a child. \"The Targaryen girl-\" \\nThe king groaned. \"Seven hells, don\\'t start with her again. That\\'s done, I\\'ll hear no more of it.\" \\n\"Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my counsel?\" \\n\"Why?\" Robert laughed. \"Why not? Someone has to rule this damnable kingdom. Put on the badge, \\nNed. It suits you. And if you ever throw it in my face again, I swear to you, I\\'ll pin the damned thing on \\nJaime Lannister.\" \\nCATELYN \\nThe eastern sky was rose and gold as the sun broke over the Vale of Arryn. Catelyn Stark watched the \\nlight spread, her hands resting on the delicate carved stone of the balustrade outside her window. Below \\nher the world turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields and forests. Pale white \\nmists rose off Alyssa\\'s Tears, where the ghost waters plunged over the shoulder of the mountain to begin \\ntheir long tumble down the face of the Giant\\'s Lance. Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her \\nface. \\nPage 287\\n\\nAlyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, and yet in life she had never \\nshed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she would know no rest until her weeping watered \\nthe black earth of the Vale, where the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six \\nthousand years now, and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. Catelyn \\nwondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died. \"Tell me the rest of it,\" she \\nsaid. \\n\"The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock,\" Ser Rodrik Cassel answered from the room behind \\nher. \"Your brother writes that he has sent riders to the Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his \\nintent, but he has had no answer. Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass \\nbelow the Golden Tooth. He \\nvows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land without first watering it with Lannister blood.\" \\nCatelyn turned away from the sunrise. Its beauty did little to lighten her mood; it seemed cruel for a day \\nto dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to. \"Edmure has sent riders and made vows,\" she \\nsaid, \"but Edmure is not the Lord of Riverrun. What of my lord father?\" \\n\"The message made no mention of Lord Hoster, my lady.\" Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. They had \\ngrown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while he was recovering from his wounds; he looked \\nalmost himself again. \\n\"My father would not have given the defense of Riverrun over to Edmure unless he was very sick,\" she \\nsaid, worried. \"I should have been woken as soon as this bird arrived.\" \\n\"Your lady sister thought it better to let you sleep, Maester Colemon told me.\" \\nA should have been woken,\" she insisted. \\n\"The maester tells me your sister planned to speak with you after the combat,\" Ser Rodrik said. \\n\"Then she still plans to go through with this mummer\\'s farce?\" Catelyn grimaced. \"The dwarf has played \\nher like a set of pipes, and she is too deaf to hear the tune. Whatever happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, \\nit is past time we took our leave. My place is at Winterfell with my sons. If you are strong enough to \\ntravel, I shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown. We can take ship from there.\" \\n\"Another ship?\" Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet he managed not to shudder. \"As you say, my \\nlady.\" \\nThe old knight waited outside her door as Catelyn summoned the servants Lysa had given her. If she \\nspoke to her sister before the duel, perhaps she could change her mind, she thought as they dressed her. \\nLysa\\'s policies varied with her moods, and her moods changed hourly. The shy girl she had known at \\nRiverrun had grown into a woman who was by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, timid, \\nstubborn, vain, and, above all, inconstant. \\nWhen that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion Lannister wished to confess, \\nCatelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to them privately, but no, nothing would do but that \\nher sister must make a show of him before half the Vale. And now this . . . \\nPage 288\\n\\n\"Lannister is my prisoner,\" she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower stairs and made their way \\nthrough the Eyrie\\'s cold white \\nhalls. Catelyn wore plain grey wool with a silvered belt. \"My sister must be reminded of that.\" \\nAt the doors to Lysa\\'s apartments, they met her uncle storming out. \"Going to join the fool\\'s festival?\" \\nSer Brynden snapped. \"I\\'d tell you to slap some sense into your sister, if I thought it would do any good, \\nbut you\\'d only bruise your hand.\" \\n\"There was a bird from Riverrun,\" Catelyn began, \"a letter from Edmure . . .\" \\n\"I know, child.\" The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden\\'s only concession to ornament. \"I \\nhad to hear it from Maester Colemon. I asked your sister for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and \\nride for Riverrun with all haste. Do you know what she told me? The Vale cannot spare a thousand \\nswords, nor even one, Uncle, she said. You are the Knight of the Gate. Your place is here.\" A gust of \\nchildish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him, and her uncle glanced darkly over his \\nshoulder. \"Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new Knight of the Gate. Black fish or no, I \\nam still a Tully. I shall leave for Riverrun by evenfall.\" \\nCatelyn could not pretend to surprise. \"Alone? You know as well as I that you will never survive the high \\nroad. Ser Rodrik and I are returning to Winterfell. Come with us, Uncle. I will give you your thousand \\nmen. Riverrun will not fight alone.\" \\nBrynden thought a moment, then nodded a brusque agreement. \"As you say. It\\'s the long way home, but \\nI\\'m more like to get there. I\\'ll wait for you below.\" He went striding off, his cloak swirling behind him. \\nCatelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik. They went through the doors to the high, nervous sound of a \\nchild\\'s giggles. \\nLysa\\'s apartments opened over a small garden, a circle of dirt and grass planted with blue flowers and \\nringed on all sides by tall white towers. The builders had intended it as a godswood, but the Eyrie rested \\non the hard stone of the mountain, and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Vale, they could \\nnot get a weirwood to take root here. So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and scattered statuary \\namidst low, flowering shrubs. It was there the two champions would meet to place their lives, and that of \\nTyrion Lannister, into the hands of the gods. \\nLysa, freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires and moonstones around her \\nmilk-white neck, was holding court on the terrace overlooking the scene of the combat, surrounded by \\nher knights, retainers, and lords high and low. Most of them still hoped to wed her, bed her, and rule the \\nVale of Arryn by her side. \\nFrom what Catelyn had seen during her stay at the Eyrie, it was a vain hope. \\nA wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert\\'s chair; there the Lord of the Eyrie sat, giggling and \\nclapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-and-white motley made two wooden knights \\nhack and slash at each other. Pitchers of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out, and \\nPage 289\\n\\nthe guests were sipping a sweet orange-scented wine from engraved silver cups. A fool\\'s festival, \\nBrynden had called it, and small wonder. \\nAcross the terrace, Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter\\'s, and nibbled a blackberry from the \\npoint of Ser Lyn Corbray\\'s dagger. They were the suitors who stood highest in Lysa\\'s favor . . . today, at \\nleast. Catelyn would have been hard-pressed to say which man was more unsuitable. Eon Hunter was \\neven older than Jon Arryn had been, half-crippled by gout, and cursed with three quarrelsome sons, each \\nmore grasping than the last. Ser Lyn was a different sort of folly; lean and handsome, heir to an ancient \\nbut impoverished house, but vain, reckless, hot-tempered . . . and, it was whispered, notoriously \\nuninterested in the intimate charms of women. \\nWhen Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a moist kiss on the cheek. \\n\"Isn\\'t it a lovely morning? The gods are smiling on us. Do try a cup of the wine, sweet sister. Lord Hunter \\nwas kind enough to send for it, from his own cellars.\" \\n\"Thank you, no. Lysa, we must talk.\" \\n\"After,\" her sister promised, already beginning to turn away from her. \\n\"Now.\" Catelyn spoke more loudly than she\\'d intended. Men were turning to look. \"Lysa, you cannot \\nmean to go ahead with this folly. Alive, the Imp has value. Dead, he is only food for crows. And if his \\nchampion should prevail here-\" \\n\"Small chance of that, my lady,\" Lord Hunter assured her, patting her shoulder with a liver-spotted hand. \\n\"Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter. He will make short work of the sellsword.\" \\n\"Will he, my lord?\" Catelyn said coolly. \"I wonder.\" She had seen Bronn fight on the high road; it was no \\naccident that he had survived the journey while other men had died. He moved like a panther, and that \\nugly sword of his seemed a part of his arm. \\nLysa\\'s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom. \"Women understand little of these \\nthings,\" Ser Morton Waynwood said. \"Ser Vardis is a knight, sweet lady. This other fellow, well, his sort \\nare all cowards at heart. Useful enough in a battle, with \\nthousands of their fellows around them, but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of \\nthem.\" \\n\"Say you have the truth of it, then,\" Catelyn said with a courtesy that made her mouth ache. \"What will \\nwe gain by the dwarf\\'s death? Do you imagine that Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a trial \\nbefore we flung him off a mountain?\" \\n\"Behead the man,\" Ser Lyn Corbray suggested. \"When the Kingslayer receives the Imp\\'s head, it will be \\na warning to him,\" \\nLysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair. \"Lord Robert wants to see him fly,\" she \\nsaid, as if that settled the matter. \"And the Imp has only himself to blame. It was he who demanded a trial \\nby combat.\" \\n\"Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if she\\'d wished to,\" Lord Hunter intoned \\nPage 290\\n\\nponderously. \\nIgnoring them all, Catelyn turned all her force on her sister. \"I remind you, Tyrion Lannister is my \\nprisoner.\" \\n\"And I remind you, the dwarf murdered my lord husband!\" Her voice rose. \"He poisoned the Hand of \\nthe King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I mean to see him pay!\" Whirling, her skirts \\nswinging around her, Lysa stalked across the terrace. Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors \\nexcused themselves with cool nods and trailed after her. \\n\"Do you think he did?\" Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone again. \"Murder Lord Jon, \\nthat is? The Imp still denies it, and most fiercely . . .\" \\n\"I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,\" Catelyn replied, \"but whether it was Tyrion, or Ser \\nJaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin to say.\" Lysa had named Cersei in the letter \\nshe had sent to Winterfell, but now she seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer . . . perhaps because the \\ndwarf was here, while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to the \\nsouth. Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister\\'s letter before reading it. \\nSer Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. \"Poison, well . . . that could be the dwarf s work, true enough. Or \\nCersei\\'s. It\\'s said poison is a woman\\'s weapon, begging your pardons, my lady. The Kingslayer, now \\nI have no great liking for the man, but he\\'s not the sort. Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden \\nsword of his. Was it poison, my lady?\" \\nCatelyn frowned, vaguely uneasy. \"How else could they make it look a natural death?\" Behind her, Lord \\nRobert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights sliced the other in half, spilling a flood of \\nred sawdust onto the terrace. She glanced at her nephew and sighed. \"The boy is utterly without \\ndiscipline. He will never be strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time.\" \\n\"His lord father agreed with you,\" said a voice at her elbow. She turned to behold Maester Colemon, a \\ncup of wine in his hand. \"He was planning to send the boy to Dragonstone for fostering, you know . . . \\noh, but I\\'m speaking out of turn.\" The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester\\'s \\nchain. \"I fear I\\'ve had too much of Lord Hunter\\'s excellent wine. The prospect of bloodshed has my \\nnerves all a-fray . . .\" \\n\"You are mistaken, Maester,\" Catelyn said. \"It was Casterly Rock, not Dragonstone, and those \\narrangements were made after the Hand\\'s death, without my sister\\'s consent.\" \\nThe maester\\'s head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck that he looked half a \\npuppet himself. \"No, begging your forgiveness, my lady, but it was Lord Jon who-\" \\nA bell tolled loudly below them. High lords and serving girls alike broke off what they were doing and \\nmoved to the balustrade. Below, two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister. The \\nEyrie\\'s plump septon escorted him to the statue in the center of the garden, a weeping woman carved in \\nveined white marble, no doubt meant to be Alyssa. \\n\"The bad little man,\" Lord Robert said, giggling. \"Mother, can I make him fly? I want to see him fly.\" \\nPage 291\\n\\n\"Later, my sweet baby,\" Lysa promised him. \\n\"Trial first,\" drawled Ser Lyn Corbray, \"then execution.\" \\nA moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the garden. The knight was \\nattended by two young squires, the sellsword by the Eyrie\\'s master-at-arms. \\nSer Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel, encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded \\nsurcoat. Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and-falcon sigil of House Arryn, \\nprotected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast. A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to \\nmidthigh, while a solid gorget encircled his throat. Falcon\\'s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm, \\nand his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision. \\nBronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He wore only a shirt of black \\noiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfhelm with a noseguard, and a mail coif. High leather \\nboots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the \\nfingers of his gloves. Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, with a \\nA CAME OF THRONES 385 \\nlonger reach ... and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if she was any judge. \\nThey knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman, facing each other, with Lannister between them. \\nThe septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft cloth bag at his waist. He lifted it high above \\nhis head, and the light shattered. Rainbows danced across the Imp\\'s face. In a high, solemn, singsong \\nvoice, the septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness, to find the truth in this man\\'s soul, to \\ngrant him life and freedom if he was innocent, death if he was guilty. His voice echoed off the surrounding \\ntowers. \\nWhen the last echo had died away, the septon lowered his crystal and made a hasty departure. Tyrion \\nleaned over and whispered something in Bronn\\'s ear before the guardsmen led him away. The sellsword \\nrose laughing and brushed a blade of grass from his knee. \\nRobert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, was fidgeting impatiently in his elevated chair. \\n\"When are they going to fight?\" he asked plaintively. \\nSer Vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires. The other brought him a triangular shield \\nalmost four feet tall, heavy oak dotted with iron studs. They strapped it to his left forearm. When Lysa\\'s \\nmaster-at-arms offered Brorm a similar shield, the sellsword spat and waved it away. Three days growth \\nof coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks, but if he did not shave it was not for want of a razor; \\nthe edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had been honed every day for hours, until it \\nwas too sharp to touch. \\nSer Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his \\ngrasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon\\'s \\nhead, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. \"I had that sword crafted for Jon in King\\'s \\nLanding,\" Lysa told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. \"He wore it \\nwhenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert\\'s place. Isn\\'t it a lovely thing? I thought it only fitting that \\nour champion avenge Jon with his own blade.\" \\nPage 292\\n\\nThe engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to Catelyn that Ser Vardis might \\nhave been more comfortable with his own sword. Yet she said nothing; she was weary of futile \\narguments with her sister. \\n\"Make them fight!\" Lord Robert called out. \\nSer Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his sword in salute. \"For the Eyrie and the Vale!\" \\nTyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden, flanked by his guards. It was to him \\nthat Bronn turned with a cursory salute. \\n\"They await your command,\" Lady Lysa said to her lord son. \\n\"Fight!\" the boy screamed, his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair. \\nSer Vardis swiveled, bringing up his heavy shield. Bronn turned to face him. Their swords rang together, \\nonce, twice, a testing. The sellsword backed off a step. The knight came after, holding his shield before \\nhim. He tried a slash, but Bronn jerked back, just out of reach, and the silver blade cut only air. Bronn \\ncircled to his right. Ser Vardis turned to follow, keeping his shield between them. The knight pressed \\nforward, placing each foot carefully on the uneven ground. The sellsword gave way, a faint smile playing \\nover his lips. Ser Vardis attacked, slashing, but Bronn leapt away from him, hopping lightly over a low, \\nmoss-covered stone. Now the sellsword circled left, away from the shield, toward the knight\\'s \\nunprotected side. Ser Vardis tried a hack at his legs, but he did not have the reach. Bronn danced farther \\nto his left. Ser Vardis turned in place. \\n\"The man is craven,\" Lord Hunter declared. \"Stand and fight, coward! \" Other voices echoed the \\nsentiment. \\nCatelyn looked to Ser Rodrik. Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his head. \"He wants to make \\nSer Vardis chase him. The weight of armor and shield will tire even the strongest man.\" \\nShe had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life, had viewed half a hundred \\ntourneys in her time, but this was something different and deadlier: a dance where the smallest misstep \\nmeant death. And as she watched, the memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn \\nStark, as vivid as if it had been yesterday. \\nThey met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore only helm and breastplate \\nand mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged her for a favor he might wear, but she had \\nturned him away. Her lord father promised her to Brandon Stark, and so it was to him that she gave her \\ntoken, a pale blue handscarf she had embroidered with the leaping trout of Riverrun. As she pressed it \\ninto his hand, she pleaded with him. \"He is only a foolish boy, but I have loved him like a brother. It \\nwould grieve me to see him die.\" And her betrothed looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and \\npromised to spare the boy who loved her. \\nThat fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, and he drove Littlefinger all \\nthe way across the bailey and down \\nPage 293\\n\\nthe water stair, raining steel on him with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from a \\ndozen wounds. \"Yield!\" he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his head and fight on, \\ngrimly. When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut \\nthat bit through Petyr\\'s rings and leather into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was \\ncertain that the wound was mortal. He looked at her as he fell and murmured \"Cat\" as the bright blood \\ncame flowing out between his mailed fingers. She thought she had forgotten that. \\nThat was the last time she had seen his face . . . until the day she was brought before him in King\\'s \\nLanding. \\nA fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, but her lord father forbade \\nher to visit him in the tower where he lay abed. Lysa helped their maester nurse him; she had been softer \\nand shyer in those days. Edmure had called on him as well, but Petyr had sent him away. Her brother \\nhad acted as Brandon\\'s squire at the duel, and Littlefinger would not forgive that. As soon as he was \\nstrong enough to be moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish away in a closed litter, to finish his \\nhealing on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut of rock where he\\'d been born. \\nThe ringing clash of steel on steel jarred Catelyn back to the present. Ser Vardis was coming hard at \\nBronn, driving into him with shield and sword. The sellsword scrambled backward, checking each blow, \\nstepping lithely over rock and root, his eyes never leaving his foe. He was quicker, Catelyn saw; the \\nknight\\'s silvered sword never came near to touching him, but his own ugly grey blade hacked a notch \\nfrom Ser Vardis\\'s shoulder plate. \\nThe brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as it had begun when Bronn sidestepped and slid behind the \\nstatue of the weeping woman. Ser Vardis lunged at where he had been, striking a spark off the pate \\nmarble of Alyssa\\'s thigh. \\n\"They\\'re not fighting good, Mother,\" the Lord of the Eyrie complained. \"I want them to fight.\" \\n\"They will, sweet baby,\" his mother soothed him. \"The sellsword can\\'t run all day.\" \\nSome of the lords on Lysa\\'s terrace were making wry jests as they refilled their wine cups, but across \\nthe garden, Tyrion Lannister\\'s mismatched eyes watched the champions dance as if there were nothing \\nelse in the world. \\nBronn came out from behind the statue hard and fast, still moving left, aiming a two-handed cut at the \\nknight\\'s unshielded right side. Ser Vardis blocked, but clumsily, and the sellsword\\'s blade flashed upward \\nat his head. Metal rang, and a falcon\\'s wing collapsed with a crunch. Ser Vardis took a half step back to \\nbrace himself, raised his shield. Oak chips flew as Bronn\\'s sword hacked at the wooden wall. The \\nsellsword stepped left again, away from the shield, and caught Ser Vardis across the stomach, the razor \\nedge of his blade leaving a bright gash when it bit into the knight\\'s plate. \\nSer Vardis drove forward off his back foot, his own silver blade descending in a savage arc. Bronn \\nslammed it aside and danced away. The knight crashed into the weeping woman, rocking her on her \\nplinth. Staggered, he stepped backward, his head turning this way and that as he searched for his foe. \\nThe slit visor of his helm narrowed his vision. \\n\"Behind you, ser!\" Lord Hunter shouted, too late. Bronn brought his sword down with both hands, \\nPage 294\\n\\ncatching Ser Vardis in the elbow of his sword arm. The thin lobstered metal that protected the joint \\ncrunched. The knight grunted, turning, wrenching his weapon up. This time Bronn stood his ground. The \\nswords flew at each other, and their steel song filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the \\nEyrie. \\n\"Ser Vardis is hurt,\" Ser Rodrik said, his voice grave. \\nCatelyn did not need to be told; she had eyes, she could see the bright finger of blood running along the \\nknight\\'s forearm, the wetness inside the elbow joint. Every parry was a little slower and a little lower than \\nthe one before. Ser Vardis turned his side to his foe, trying to use his shield to block instead, but Bronn \\nslid around him, quick as a cat. The sellsword seemed to be getting stronger. His cuts were leaving their \\nmarks now. Deep shiny gashes gleamed all over the knight\\'s armor, on his right thigh, his beaked visor, \\ncrossing on his breastplate, a long one along the front of his gorget. The moon-and-falcon rondel over \\nSer Vardis\\'s right arm was sheared clean in half, hanging by its strap. They could hear his labored breath, \\nrattling through the air holes in his visor. \\nBlind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was happening \\nbelow them, yet her sister could not. \"Enough, Ser Vardis!\" Lady Lysa called down. \"Finish him now, my \\nbaby is growing tired.\" \\nAnd it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady\\'s command, even to the last. One \\nmoment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind his scarred shield; the next he charged. The \\nsudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance. Ser Vardis crashed into him and slammed the lip of his shield \\ninto the sellsword\\'s face. Almost, almost, Bronn lost his feet . . . he staggered back, tripped over a rock, \\nand caught hold of the weeping woman to keep his balance. \\nThrowing aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after him, using both hands to raise his sword. His right \\narm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet his last desperate blow would have opened Bronn from \\nneck to navel . . . if the sellsword had stood to receive it. \\nBut Bronn jerked back. Jon Arryn\\'s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced off the marble elbow of the \\nweeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way up the blade. Bronn put his shoulder into the \\nstatue\\'s back. The weathered likeness of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser \\nVardis Egen went down beneath her. \\nBronn was on him in a heartbeat, kicking what was left of his shattered rondel aside to expose the weak \\nspot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on his side, pinned beneath the broken torso of \\nthe weeping woman. Catelyn heard the knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and \\ndrove it down and in with all his weight behind it, under the arm and through the ribs. Ser Vardis Egen \\nshuddered and lay still. \\nSilence hung over the Eyrie. Bronn yanked off his halfhelm and let it fall to the grass. His lip was \\nsmashed and bloody where the shield had caught him, and his coal-black hair was soaked with sweat. \\nHe spit out a broken tooth. \\n\"Is it over, Mother?\" the Lord of the Eyrie asked. \\nNo, Catelyn wanted to tell him, it\\'s only now beginning. \\nPage 295\\n\\n\"Yes,\" Lysa said glumly, her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her guard. \\n\"Can I make the little man fly now?\" \\nAcross the garden, Tyrion Lannister got to his feet. \"Not this little man,\" he said. \"This little man is going \\ndown in the turnip hoist, thank you very much.\" \\n\"You presume-\" Lysa began. \\n\"I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words,\" the Imp said. \"As High as Honor. \" \\n\"You promised I could make him fly,\" the Lord of the Eyrie screamed at his mother. He began to shake. \\nLady Lysa\\'s face was flushed with fury. \"The gods have seen fit to proclaim him innocent, child. We \\nhave no choice but to free him.\" She lifted her voice. \"Guards. Take my lord of Lannister and his . . . \\ncreature here out of my sight. Escort them to the Bloody Gate and set them free. See that they have \\nhorses and supplies sufficient to reach the Trident, and make certain all their goods and weapons are \\nreturned to them. They shall need them on the high road.\" \\n\"The high road,\" Tyrion Lannister said. Lysa allowed herself a faint, satisfied smile. It was another sort of \\ndeath sentence, Catelyn realized. Tyrion Lannister must know that as well. Yet the dwarf favored Lady \\nArryn with a mocking bow. \"As you command, my lady,\" he said. \"I believe we know the way.\" \\nJON \\nYou are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained,\" Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all \\nassembled in the yard. \"Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to \\nme, the lot of you would be set to herding swine. But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five \\nnew boys up the kingsroad. One or two may even be worth the price of piss. To make room for them, I \\nhave decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as he will.\" He called out the \\nnames one by one. \"Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple. Monkey. Ser Loon.\" Last, he looked \\nat Jon. \"And the Bastard.\" \\nPyp let fly a whoop and thrust his sword into the air. Ser Alliser fixed him with a reptile stare. \"They will \\ncall you men of Night\\'s Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer\\'s Monkey here if you \\nbelieve that. You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die \\nlike flies.\" And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them. \\nThe other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and offering \\ncongratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of his sword and shouted, \"Toad, of the \\nNight\\'s Watch!\" Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn\\'s shoulders, and they \\ntumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting. Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned \\nwith a skin of sour red. As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed \\nSamwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard. Jon offered him the \\nPage 296\\n\\nskin. \"A swallow of wine?\" \\nSam shook his head. \"No thank you, Jon.\" \\n\"Are you well?\" \\n\"Very well, truly,\" the fat boy lied. \"I am so happy for you all.\" His round face quivered as he forced a \\nsmile. \"You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.\" \\n\"Is, \" Jon corrected. He would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead. Before he could say more, \\nHaider cried, \"Here, you planning to drink that all yourself?\" Pyp snatched the skin from his hand and \\ndanced away, laughing. While Grenn seized his arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of \\nred squirted Jon in the face. Haider howled in protest at the waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and \\nstruggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs. \\nBy the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his surcoat, Samwell Tarly had \\ngone. \\nThat night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion. When Jon arrived \\nat the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him to the bench near the fire. The older men clapped \\nhim on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of \\ngarlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in \\nbutter. \"From the Lord Commander\\'s own table,\" Bowen Marsh told them. There were salads of spinach \\nand chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream. \\n\"Do you think they\\'ll keep us together?\" Pyp wondered as they gorged themselves happily. \\nToad made a face. \"I hope not. I\\'m sick of looking at those ears of yours.\" \\n\"Ho,\" said Pyp. \"Listen to the crow call the raven black. You\\'re certain to be a ranger, Toad. They\\'ll \\nwant you as far from the castle as they can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, \\nand he\\'ll run off screaming.\" \\nEveryone laughed but Grenn. \"I hope I\\'m a ranger.\" \\n\"You and everyone else,\" said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man \\nwas expected to take up steel in its defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night\\'s \\nWatch. It was they who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through \\nthe haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting wildlings and giants \\nand monstrous snow bears. \\n\"Not everyone,\" said Halder. \"It\\'s the builders for me. What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?\" \\nThe order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig \\ntunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the \\nforest pressed too close to the Wall. Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from \\nfrozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever \\nhigher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from \\nPage 297\\n\\nEastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they \\ncould. \\n\"The Old Bear\\'s no fool,\" Dareon observed. \"You\\'re certain to be a builder, and Jon\\'s certain to be a \\nranger. He\\'s the best sword and the best rider among us, and his uncle was the First before he . . .\" His \\nvoice trailed off awkwardly as he realized what he had almost said. \\n\"Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,\" Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl of blueberries. The rest \\nmight have given up all hope of his uncle\\'s safe return, but not him. He pushed away the berries, scarcely \\ntouched, and rose from the bench. \\n\"Aren\\'t you going to eat those?\" Toad asked. \\n\"They\\'re yours.\" Jon had hardly tasted Hobb\\'s great feast. \"I could not eat another bite.\" He took his \\ncloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way out. \\nPyp followed him. \"Jon, what is it?\" \\n\"Sam,\" he admitted. \"He was not at table tonight.\" \\n\"It\\'s not like him to miss a meal,\" Pyp said thoughtfully. \"Do you suppose he\\'s taken ill?\" \\n\"He\\'s frightened. We\\'re leaving him.\" He remembered the day he had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet \\nfarewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he\\'d given her \\nNeedle. \"Once we say our words, we\\'ll all have duties to attend to. Some of us may be sent away, to \\nEastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these \\nnew boys who are coming up the kingsroad. Gods only know what they\\'ll be like, but you can bet Ser \\nAlliser will send them against him, first chance he gets.\" \\nPyp made a grimace. \"You did all you could.\" \\n\"All we could wasn\\'t enough,\" Jon said. \\nA deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin\\'s Tower for Ghost. The direwolf walked \\nbeside him to the stables. Some of the \\nmore skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered. Jon saddled his mare, \\nmounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of him, \\nflying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. Jon let him go. A wolf needed to hunt. \\nHe had no destination in mind. He wanted only to ride. He followed the creek for a time, listening to the \\nicy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad. It stretched out before him, \\nnarrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon \\nSnow with a vast longing. Winterfell was down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King\\'s Landing and \\nthe Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isles of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the \\nhundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria. All the places that Jon would \\nnever see. The world was down that road . . . and he was here. \\nOnce he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as Maester Aemon. \"I have not \\nPage 298\\n\\nsworn yet,\" he muttered. He was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes. \\nHe had come here freely, and he might leave freely . . . until he said the words. He need only ride on, and \\nhe could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in Winterfell with his \\nbrothers. \\nYour half brothers, a voice inside reminded him. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was \\nno place for him in Winterfell, no place in King\\'s Landing either. Even his own mother had not had a \\nplace for him. The thought of her made him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked \\nlike, why his father had left her. Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and \\ndishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her? \\nJon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him. The fires of Castle Black were hidden \\nbehind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to \\nhorizon. \\nHe wheeled his horse around and started for home. \\nGhost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander\\'s \\nTower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he trotted beside the horse. Jon found himself \\nthinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he \\nmust do. \\nMaester Aemon\\'s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and frail, the \\nmaester shared his chambers with two \\nof the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties. The brothers joked that \\nhe had been given the two ugliest men in the Night\\'s Watch; being blind, he was spared having to look at \\nthem. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on his neck \\nthe size of a pigeon\\'s egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why he always \\nseemed so angry. \\nIt was Chett who answered Jon\\'s knock. \"I need to speak to Maester Aemon,\" Jon told him. \\n\"The maester is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe he\\'ll see you.\" He began \\nto shut the door. \\nJon jammed it open with his boot. \"I need to speak to him now. The morning will be too late.\" \\nChett scowled. \"The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do you know how old he \\nis?\" \\n\"Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,\" Jon said. \"Give him my pardons. I would not \\ndisturb his rest if it were not important.\" \\n\"And if I refuse?\" \\nJon had his boot wedged solidly in the door. \"I can stand here all night if I must.\" \\nThe black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him. \"Wait in the library. \\nPage 299\\n\\nThere\\'s wood. Start a fire. I won\\'t have the maester catching a chill on account of you.\" \\nJon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. The old man was clad in his \\nbed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of his order. A maester did not remove it even to \\nsleep. \"The chair beside the fire would be pleasant,\" he said when he felt the warmth on his face. When \\nhe was settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door. \\n\"I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,\" Jon Snow said. \\n\"You did not wake me,\" Maester Aemon replied. \"I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am \\ngrown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were \\nyesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you \\ncome calling at this strange hour?\" \\n\"To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night\\'s Watch.\" \\n\"This is no concern of Maester Aemon,\" Chett complained. \\n\"Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne,\" the \\nmaester said gently. \"Only he may \\nsay when a boy is ready to swear his vow, as you surely know. Why then come to me?\" \\n\"The Lord Commander listens to you,\" Jon told him. \"And the wounded and the sick of the Night\\'s \\nWatch are in your charge.\" \\n\"And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?\" \\n\"He will be,\" Jon promised, \"unless you help.\" \\nHe told them all of it, even the part where he\\'d set Ghost at Rast\\'s throat. Maester Aemon listened \\nsilently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett\\'s face darkened with each word. \"Without us to keep him \\nsafe, Sam will have no chance,\" Jon finished. \"He\\'s hopeless with a sword. My sister Arya could tear him \\napart, and she\\'s not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it\\'s only a matter of time before he\\'s hurt or \\nkilled.\" \\nChett could stand no more. \"I\\'ve seen this fat boy in the common hall,\" he said. \"He is a pig, and a \\nhopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.\" \\n\"Maybe it is so,\" Maester Aemon said. \"Tell me, Chett, what would you have us do with such a boy?\" \\n\"Leave him where he is,\" Chett said. \"The Wall is no place for the weak. Let him train until he is ready, \\nno matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.\" \\n\"That\\'s stupid, \" Jon said. He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts. \"I remember once I asked \\nMaester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.\" \\nMaester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links. \\n\"Go on.\" \\nPage 300\\n\\n\"He told me that a maester\\'s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve,\" Jon said, \\nremembering. \"I asked why each link was a different metal. A silver chain would look much finer with his \\ngrey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A maester forges his chain with study, he told me. The \\ndifferent metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for \\nhealing, iron for warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. The collar is supposed to \\nremind a maester of the realm he serves, isn\\'t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links \\ncan\\'t make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, \\nand those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a \\nland needs all sorts of people.\" \\nMaester Aemon smiled. \"And so?\" \\n\"The Night\\'s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll \\ncouldn\\'t make Sam a warrior, \\nand Ser Alliser won\\'t either. You can\\'t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that \\ndoesn\\'t mean tin is useless. Why shouldn\\'t Sam be a steward?\" \\nChett gave an angry scowl. \"I\\'m a steward. You think it\\'s easy work, fit for cowards? The order of \\nstewards keeps the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, \\ncook the meals. Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The \\nstewards.\" \\nMaester Aemon was gentler. \"Is your friend a hunter?\" \\n\"He hates hunting,\" Jon had to admit. \\n\"Can he plow a field?\" the maester asked. \"Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a \\ncow?\" \\n\"No.,, \\nChett gave a nasty laugh. \"I\\'ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when they\\'re put to work. Set them to \\nchurning butter and their hands blister and bleed. Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their \\nown foot.\" \\n\"I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.\" \\n\"Yes?\" Maester Aemon prompted. \\nJon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry. \"He could help you,\" he \\nsaid quickly. \"He can do sums, and he knows how to read and write. I know Chett can\\'t read, and \\nClydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in his father\\'s library. He\\'d be good with the ravens too. \\nAnimals seem to like him. Ghost took to him straight off. There\\'s a lot he could do, besides fighting. The \\nNight\\'s Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him instead.\" \\nMaester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he had gone to sleep. \\nFinally he said, \"Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would \\nPage 301\\n\\nseem.\" \\n\"Does that mean . . . T\\' \\n\"It means I shall think on what you have said,\" the maester told him firmly. \"And now, I believe I am \\nready to sleep. Chett, show our young brother to the door.\" \\nTYRION \\nThey had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road. Tyrion was gathering \\ndeadwood while their horses took water from a mountain stream. He stooped to pick up a splintered \\nbranch and examined it critically. \"Will this do? I am not practiced at starting fires. Morrec did that for \\nme.\" \\n\"Afire?\" Bronn said, spitting. \"Are you so hungry to die, dwarf? Or have you taken leave of your senses? \\nA fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles around. I mean to survive this journey, Lannister.\" \\n\"And how do you hope to do that?\" Tyrion asked. He tucked the branch under his arm and poked \\naround through the sparse undergrowth, looking for more. His back ached from the effort of bending; \\nthey had been riding since daybreak, when a stone-faced Ser Lyn Corbray had ushered them through the \\nBloody Gate and commanded them never to return. \\n\"We have no chance of fighting our way back,\" Bronn said, \"but two can cover more ground than ten, \\nand attract less notice. The fewer days we spend in these mountains, the more like we are to reach the \\nriverlands. Ride hard and fast, I say. Travel by night and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, \\nmake no noise and light no fires.\" \\nTyrion Lannister sighed. \"A splendid plan, Bronn. Try it, as you like . . . and forgive me if I do not linger \\nto bury you.\" \\n\"You think to outlive me, dwarf?\" The sellsword grinned. He had a dark gap in his smile where the edge \\nof Ser Vardis Egen\\'s shield had cracked a tooth in half. \\nTyrion shrugged. \"Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down a mountain and crack your \\nskull. I prefer to make my crossing slow and easy. I know you love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our \\nmounts die under us this time, we\\'ll be trying to saddle shadowcats . . . and if truth be told, I think the \\nclans will find us no matter what we do. Their eyes are all around us.\" He swept a gloved hand over the \\nhigh, wind-carved crags that surrounded them. \\nBronn grimaced. \"Then we\\'re dead men, Lannister.\" \\n\"If so, I prefer to die comfortable,\" Tyrion replied. \"We need a fire. The nights are cold up here, and hot \\nfood will warm our bellies and lift our spirits. Do you suppose there\\'s any game to be had? Lady Lysa \\nhas kindly provided us with a veritable feast of salt beef, hard cheese, and stale bread, but I would hate \\nto break a tooth so far from the nearest maester.\" \\n\"I can find meat.\" Beneath a fall of black hair, Bronn\\'s dark eyes regarded Tyrion suspiciously. \"I should \\nPage 302\\n\\nleave you here with your fool\\'s fire. If I took your horse, I\\'d have twice the chance to make it through. \\nWhat would you do then, dwarf?\" \\n\"Die, most like.\" Tyrion stooped to get another stick. \\n\"You don\\'t think I\\'d do it?\" \\n\"You\\'d do it in an instant, if it meant your life. You were quick enough to silence your friend Chiggen \\nwhen he caught that arrow in his belly.\" Bronn had yanked back the man\\'s head by the hair and driven \\nthe point of his dirk in under the ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died \\nof his wound. \\n\"He was good as dead,\" Bronn said, \"and his moaning was bringing them down on us. Chiggen would \\nhave done the same for me . . . and he was no friend, only a man I rode with. Make no mistake, dwarf. I \\nfought for you, but I do not love you.\" \\n\"It was your blade I needed,\" Tyrion said, \"not your love.\" He dumped his armful of wood on the \\nground. \\nBronn grinned. \"You\\'re bold as any sellsword, I\\'ll give you that. How did you know I\\'d take your part?\" \\n\"Know?\" Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire. \"I tossed the dice. Back at the \\ninn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive. Why? The others saw it as their duty, for the honor of the \\nlords they served, but not you two. You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to \\ninvolve yourselves?\" He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of the sticks \\nhe\\'d gathered, to serve as kindling. \"Well, why do sellswords do anything? For gold. You were thinking \\nLady Catelyn would reward you for your help, perhaps even take you into her service. Here, that should \\ndo, I hope. Do you have a flint?\" \\nBronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a flint. Tyrion caught it in the air. \\n\"My thanks,\" he said. \"The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable, \\nand honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you \\nwhen this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that\\'s \\nthe most you could have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they \\nchoose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.\" Tyrion struck the flint \\nagainst his dagger, trying for a spark. Nothing. \\nBronn snorted. \"You have a bold tongue, little man. One day someone is like to cut it out and make you \\neat it.\" \\n\"Everyone tells me that.\" Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword. \"Did I offend you? My pardons . . . but you \\nare scum, Bronn, make no mistake. Duty, honor, friendship, what\\'s that to you? No, don\\'t trouble \\nyourself, we both know the answer. Still, you\\'re not stupid. Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had \\nno more need of you . . . but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold. When \\nthe moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best \\ninterest lay. Happily for me, you did.\" He slammed stone and steel together again, fruitlessly. \\nPage 303\\n\\n\"Here,\" said Bronn, squatting, \"I\\'ll do it.\" He took the knife and flint from Tyrion\\'s hands and struck \\nsparks on his first try. A curl of bark began to smolder. \\n\"Well done,\" Tyrion said. \"Scum you may be, but you\\'re undeniably useful, and with a sword in your \\nhand you\\'re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? \\nKeep me alive, and you\\'ll have it.\" \\nBronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leapt up higher. \"And if you die?\" \\n\"Why then, I\\'ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,\" Tyrion said, grinning. \"The gold ends when I \\ndo.\" \\nThe fire was blazing up nicely. Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into his pouch, and tossed Tyrion his \\ndagger. \"Fair enough,\" he said. \"My sword\\'s yours, then . . . but don\\'t go looking for me to bend the knee \\nand m7ord you every time you take a shit. I\\'m no man\\'s toady.\" \\n\"Nor any man\\'s friend,\" Tyrion said. \"I\\'ve no doubt you\\'d betray me \\nas quick as you did Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it. If the day ever comes when you\\'re tempted to \\nsell me out, remember this, Bronn-I\\'ll match their price, whatever it is. I like living. And now, do you \\nthink you could do something about finding us some supper?\" \\n\"Take care of the horses,\" Bronn said, unsheathing the long dirk he wore at his hip. He strode into the \\ntrees. \\nAn hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed, the fire was crackling away merrily, and a \\nhaunch of a young goat was turning above the flames, spitting and hissing. \"All we lack now is some good \\nwine to wash down our kid,\" Tyrion said. \\n\"That, a woman, and another dozen swords,\" Bronn said. He sat cross-legged beside the fire, honing the \\nedge of his longsword with an oilstone. There was something strangely reassuring about the rasping \\nsound it made when he drew it down the steel. \"It will be full dark soon,\" the sellsword pointed out. \"I\\'ll \\ntake first watch . . . for all the good it will do us. It might be kinder to let them kill us in our sleep.\" \\n\"Oh, I imagine they\\'ll be here long before it comes to sleep.\" The smell of the roasting meat made \\nTyrion\\'s mouth water. \\nBronn watched him across the fire. \"You have a plan,\" he said flatly, with a scrape of steel on stone. \\n\"A hope, call it,\" Tyrion said. \"Another toss of the dice.\" \\n\"With our lives as the stake?\" \\nTyrion shrugged. \"What choice do we have?\" He leaned over the fire and sawed a thin slice of meat \\nfrom the kid. \"Ahhhh,\" he sighed happily as he chewed. Grease ran down his chin. \"A bit tougher than I\\'d \\nlike, and in want of spicing, but I\\'ll not complain too loudly. If I were back at the Eyrie, I\\'d be dancing on \\na precipice in hopes of a boiled bean.\" \\n\"And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold,\" Bronn said. \\nPage 304\\n\\n\"A Lannister always pays his debts.\" \\nEven Mord had scarcely believed it when Tyrion tossed him the leather purse. The gaoler\\'s eyes had \\ngone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open- the drawstring and beheld the glint of gold. \"I kept the \\nsilver,\" Tyrion had told him with a crooked smile, \"but you were promised the gold, and there it is.\" It \\nwas more than a man like Mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners. \"And remember \\nwhat I said, this is only a taste. If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn\\'s service, present yourself at \\nCasterly Rock, and I\\'ll pay you the rest of what I owe you.\" With golden dragons spilling out of both \\nhands, Mord had fallen to his knees and promised that he would do just that. \\nBronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire. He began to carve thick chunks of charred \\nmeat off the bone as Tyrion \\n402 GEORGE R.R. MARUN \\nhollowed out two heels of stale bread to serve as trenchers. \"If we do reach the river, what will you do \\nthen?\" the sellsword asked as he cut. \\n\"Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start.\" Tyrion held out his trencher, and Bronn \\nfilled it with meat. \"And then to Casterly Rock or King\\'s Landing, I think. I have some questions that \\nwant answering, concerning a certain dagger.\" \\nThe sellsword chewed and swallowed. \"So you were telling it true? It was not your knife?\" \\nTyrion smiled thinly. \"Do I look a liar to you?\" \\nBy the time their bellies were full, the stars had come out and a halfmoon was rising over the mountains. \\nTyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and stretched out with his saddle for a pillow. \"Our \\nfriends are taking their sweet time.\" \\n\"If I were them, I\\'d fear a trap,\" Bronn said. \"Why else would we be so open, if not to lure them in?\" \\nTyrion chuckled. \"Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror.\" He began to whistle a tune. \\n\"You\\'re mad, dwarf,\" Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his nails with his dirk. \\n\"Where\\'s your love of music, Bronn?\" \\n\"If it was music you wanted, you should have gotten the singer to champion you.\" \\nTyrion grinned. \"That would have been amusing. I can just see him fending off Ser Vardis with his \\nwoodharp.\" He resumed his whistling. \"Do you know this song?\" he asked. \\n\"You hear it here and there, in inns and whorehouses.\" \\n\"Myrish. \\'The Seasons of My Love.\\' Sweet and sad, if you understand the words. The first girl I ever \\nbedded used to sing it, and I\\'ve never been able to put it out of my head.\" Tyrion gazed up at the sky. It \\nwas a clear cold night and the stars shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth. \"I \\nmet her on a night like this,\" he heard himself saying. \"Jaime and I were riding back from Lannisport when \\nwe heard a scream, and she came running out into the road with two men dogging her heels, shouting \\nPage 305\\n\\nthreats. My brother unsheathed his sword and went after them, while I dismounted to protect the girl. \\nShe was scarcely a year older than I was, dark-haired, slender, with a face that would break your heart. \\nIt certainly broke mine. Lowborn, halfstarved, unwashed . . . yet lovely. They\\'d torn the rags she was \\nwearing half off her back, so I wrapped her in my cloak while Jaime chased the men into the woods. By \\nthe time he came trotting back, I\\'d gotten a name out of her, and a story. She was a crofter\\'s child, \\norphaned \\nwhen her father died of fever, on her way to ... well, nowhere, really. \\n\"Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men. It was not often outlaws dared prey on travelers so near \\nto Casterly Rock, and he took it as an insult. The girl was too frightened to send off by herself, though, so \\nI offered to take her to the closest inn and feed her while my brother rode back to the Rock for help. \\n\"She was hungrier than I would have believed. We finished two whole chickens and part of a third, and \\ndrank a flagon of wine, talking. I was only thirteen, and the wine went to my head, I fear. The next thing I \\nknew, I was sharing her bed. If she was shy, I was shyer. I\\'ll never know where I found the courage. \\nWhen I broke her maidenhead, she wept, but afterward she kissed me and sang her little song, and by \\nmorning I was in love.\" \\n\"You?\" Bronn\\'s voice was amused. \\n\"Absurd, isn\\'t it?\" Tyrion began to whistle the song again. \"I married her,\" he finally admitted. \\n\"A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter\\'s daughter,\" Bronn said. \"How did you manage that?\" \\n\"Oh, you\\'d be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies, fifty pieces of silver, and a drunken \\nsepton. I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I set her up in a cottage of her own, and \\nfor a fortnight we played at being man and wife. And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my \\nlord father.\" Tyrion was surprised at how desolate it made him feel to say it, even after all these years. \\nPerhaps he was just tired. \"That was the end of my marriage.\" He sat up and stared at the dying fire, \\nblinking at the light. \\n\"He sent the girl away?\" \\n\"He did better than that,\" Tyrion said. \"First he made my brother tell me the truth. The girl was a whore, \\nyou see. Jaime arranged the whole affair, the road, the outlaws, all of it. He thought it was time I had a \\nwoman. He paid double for a maiden, knowing it would be my first time. \\n\"After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin brought my wife in and \\ngave her to his guards. They paid her fair enough. A silver for each man, how many whores command \\nthat high a price? He sat me down in the corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she \\nhad so many silvers the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor, she . . .\" The \\nsmoke was stinging his eyes. Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the fire, to gaze out into \\ndarkness. \"Lord Tywin had me go last,\" \\nhe said in a quiet voice. \"And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and worth \\nmore.\" \\nPage 306\\n\\nAfter a time he heard the noise again, the rasp of steel on stone as Bronn sharpened his sword. \"Thirteen \\nor thirty or three, I would have killed the man who did that to me.\" \\nTyrion swung around to face him. \"You may get that chance one day. Remember what I told you. A \\nLannister always pays his debts.\" He yawned. \"I think I will try and sleep. Wake me if we\\'re about to \\ndie.\" \\nHe rolled himself up in the shadowskin and shut his eyes. The ground was stony and cold, but after a \\ntime Tyrion Lannister did sleep. He dreamt of the sky cell. This time he was the gaoler, not the prisoner, \\nbig, with a strap in his hand, and he was hitting his father, driving him back, toward the abyss . . . \\n\"Tyrion. \" Bronn\\'s warning was low and urgent. \\nTyrion was awake in the blink of an eye. The fire had burned down to embers, and the shadows were \\ncreeping in all around them. Bronn had raised himself to one knee, his sword in one hand and his dirk in \\nthe other. Tyrion held up a hand: stay still, it said. \"Come share our fire, the night is cold,\" he called out to \\nthe creeping shadows. \"I fear we\\'ve no wine to offer you, but you\\'re welcome to some of our goat.\" \\nAll movement stopped. Tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal. \"Our mountain,\" a voice called out \\nfrom the trees, deep and hard and unfriendly. \"Our goat.\" \\n\"Your goat,\" Tyrion agreed. \"Who are you?\" \\n\"When you meet your gods,\" a different voice replied, \"say it was Gunthor son of Gurn of the Stone \\nCrows who sent you to them.\" A branch cracked underfoot as he stepped into the light; a thin man in a \\nhorned helmet, armed with a long knife. \\n\"And Shagga son of Dolf.\" That was the first voice, deep and deadly. A boulder shifted to their left, and \\nstood, and became a man. Massive and slow and strong he seemed, dressed all in skins, with a club in \\nhis right hand and an axe in his left. He smashed them together as he lumbered closer. \\nOther voices called other names, Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that Tyrion forgot the instant he \\nheard them; ten at least. A few had swords and knives; others brandished pitchforks and scythes and \\nwooden spears. He waited until they were done shouting out their names before he gave them answer. \"I \\nam Tyrion son of Tywin, of the Clan Lannister, the Lions of the Rock. We will gladly pay you for the \\ngoat we ate.\" \\n\"What do you have to give us, Tyrion son of Tywin?\" asked the one who named himself Gunthor, who \\nseemed to be their chief. \\n\"There is silver in my purse,\" Tyrion told them. \"This hauberk I wear is large for me, but it should fit \\nConn nicely, and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga\\'s mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he \\nholds.\" \\n\"The halfman would pay us with our own coin,\" said Conn. \\n\"Conn speaks truly,\" Gunthor said. \"Your silver is ours. Your horses are ours. Your hauberk and your \\nbattle-axe and the knife at your belt, those are ours too. You have nothing to give us but your lives. How \\nPage 307\\n\\nwould you like to die, Tyrion son of Tywin?\" \\n\"In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden\\'s mouth around my cock, at the age of eighty,\" he \\nreplied. \\nThe huge one, Shagga, laughed first and loudest. The others seemed less amused. \"Conn, take their \\nhorses,\" Gunthor commanded. \"Kill the other and seize the halfinan. He can milk the goats and make the \\nmothers laugh.\" \\nBronn sprang to his feet. \"Who dies first?\" \\n\"No!\" Tyrion said sharply. \"Gunthor son of Gurn, hear me. My House is rich and powerful. If the Stone \\nCrows will see us safely through these mountains, my lord father will shower you with gold.\" \\n\"The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfman\\'s promises,\" Gunthor said. \\n\"Half a man I may be,\" Tyrion said, \"yet I have the courage to face my enemies. What do the Stone \\nCrows do, but hide behind rocks and shiver with fear as the knights of the Vale ride by?\" \\nShagga gave a roar of anger and clashed club against axe. Jaggot poked at Tyrion\\'s face with the \\nfire-hardened point of a long wooden spear. He did his best not to flinch. \"Are these the best weapons \\nyou could steal?\" he said. \"Good enough for killing sheep, perhaps . . . if the sheep do not fight back. My \\nfather\\'s smiths shit better steel.\" \\n\"Little boyman,\" Shagga roared, \"will you mock my axe after I chop off your manhood and feed it to the \\ngoats?\" \\nBut Gunthor raised a hand. \"No. I would hear his words. The mothers go hungry, and steel fills more \\nmouths than gold. What would you give us for your lives, Tyrion son of Tywin? Swords? Lances? Mail?\" \\n\"All that, and more, Gunthor son of Gurn,\" Tyrion Lannister replied, smiling. \"I will give you the Vale of \\nArryn.\" \\nEDDARD \\nThrough the high narrow windows of the Red Keep\\'s cavernous throne room, the light of sunset spilled \\nacross the floor, laying dark red stripes upon the walls where the heads of dragons had once hung. Now \\nthe stone was covered with hunting tapestries, vivid with greens and browns and blues, and yet still it \\nseemed to Ned Stark that the only color in the hall was the red of blood. \\nHe sat high upon the immense ancient seat of Aegon the Conqueror, an ironwork monstrosity of spikes \\nand jagged edges and grotesquely twisted metal. It was, as Robert had warned him, a hellishly \\nuncomfortable chair, and never more so than now, with his shattered leg throbbing more sharply every \\nminute. The metal beneath him had grown harder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it \\nimpossible to lean back. A king should never sit easy, Aegon the Conqueror had said, when he \\ncommanded his armorers to forge a great seat from the swords laid down by his enemies. Damn Aegon \\nfor his arrogance, Ned thought sullenly, and damn Robert and his hunting as well. \\n\"You are quite certain these were more than brigands?\" Varys asked softly from the council table \\nPage 308\\n\\nbeneath the throne. Grand Maester Pycelle stirred uneasily beside him, while Littlefinger toyed with a \\npen. They were the only councillors in attendance. A white hart had been sighted in the kingswood, and \\nLord Renly and Ser Barristan had joined the king to hunt it, along with Prince Joffrey, Sandor Clegane, \\nBalon Swann, and half the court. So Ned must needs sit the Iron Throne in his absence. \\nAt least he could sit. Save the council, the rest must stand respectfully, or kneel. The petitioners \\nclustered near the tall doors, the knights and high lords and ladies beneath the tapestries, the smallfolk in \\nthe gallery, the mailed guards in their cloaks, gold or grey: all stood. \\nThe villagers were kneeling: men, women, and children, alike tattered and bloody, their faces drawn by \\nfear. The three knights who had brought them here to bear witness stood behind them. \\n\"Brigands, Lord Varys?\" Ser Raymun Darry\\'s voice dripped scorn. \"Oh, they were brigands, beyond a \\ndoubt. Lannister brigands.\" \\nNed could feel the unease in the hall, as high lords and servants alike strained to listen. He could not \\npretend to surprise. The west had been a tinderbox since Catelyn had seized Tyrion Lannister. Both \\nRiverrun and Casterly Rock had called their banners, and armies were massing in the pass below the \\nGolden Tooth. It had only been a matter of time until the blood began to flow. The sole question that \\nremained was how best to stanch the wound. \\nSad-eyed Ser Karyl Vance, who would have been handsome but for the winestain birthmark that \\ndiscolored his face, gestured at the kneeling villagers. \"This is all the remains of the holdfast of Sherrer, \\nLord Eddard. The rest are dead, along with the people of Wendish Town and the Mummer\\'s Ford.\" \\n\"Rise,\" Ned commanded the villagers. He never trusted what a man told him from his knees. \"All of you, \\nup.\" \\nIn ones and twos, the holdfast of Sherrer struggled to its feet. One ancient needed to be helped, and a \\nyoung girl in a bloody dress stayed on her knees, staring blankly at Ser Arys Oakheart, who stood by the \\nfoot of the throne in the white armor of the Kingsguard, ready to protect and defend the king . . . or, Ned \\nsupposed, the King\\'s Hand. \\n\"Joss,\" Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer\\'s apron. \"Tell the Hand what \\nhappened at Sherrer.\" \\nJoss nodded. \"If it please His Grace-\" \\n\"His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater,\" Ned said, wondering how a man could live his whole life a \\nfew days ride from the Red Keep and still have no notion what his king looked like. Ned was clad in a \\nwhite linen doublet with the direwolf of Stark on the breast; his black wool cloak was fastened at the \\ncollar by his silver hand of office. Black and white and grey, all the shades of truth. \"I am Lord Eddard \\nStark, the King\\'s Hand. Tell me who you are and what you know of these raiders.\" \\n\"I keep . . . I kept . . . I kept an alehouse, m\\'lord, in Sherrer, by \\nPage 309\\n\\nthe stone bridge. The finest ale south of the Neck, everyone said so, begging your pardons, m1ord. It\\'s \\ngone now like all the rest, m\\'lord. They come and drank their fill and spilled the rest before they fired my \\nroof, and they would of spilled my blood too, if they\\'d caught me. M\\'lord.\" \\n\"They burnt us out,\" a farmer beside him said. \"Come riding in the dark, up from the south, and fired the \\nfields and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop them. They weren\\'t no raiders, though, m1ord. \\nThey had no mind to steal our stock, not these, they butchered my milk cow where she stood and left her \\nfor the flies and the crows.\" \\n\"They rode down my \\'prentice boy,\" said a squat man with a smith\\'s muscles and a bandage around his \\nhead. He had put on his finest clothes to come to court, but his breeches were patched, his cloak \\ntravel-stained and dusty. \"Chased him back and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with \\ntheir lances like it was a game, them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced \\nhim clean through.\" \\nThe girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned, high above her on the throne. \"They killed my mother \\ntoo, Your Grace. And they . . . they . . .\" Her voice trailed off, as if she had forgotten what she was \\nabout to say. She began to sob. \\nSer Raymun Darry took up the tale. \"At Wendish Town, the people sought shelter in their holdfast, but \\nthe walls were timbered. The raiders piled straw against the wood and burnt them all alive. When the \\nWendish folk opened their gates to flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running \\nout, even women with suckling babes.\" \\n\"Oh, dreadful,\" murmured Varys. \"How cruel can men be?\" \\n\"They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast\\'s made of stone,\" Joss said. \"Some \\nwanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was riper fruit upriver, and they made for the \\nMummer\\'s Ford.\" \\nNed could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward. Between each finger was a blade, the \\npoints of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the throne. Even after three centuries, some \\nwere still sharp enough to cut. The Iron Throne was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had \\ntaken a thousand blades to make it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread. \\nThe hammering had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was this hunched black beast made of razor \\nedges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal; a chair that could kill a man, and had, if the stories could be \\nbelieved. \\nWhat Eddard Stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend, yet there he sat, and these \\npeople looked to him for justice. \"What proof do you have that these were Lannisters?\" he asked, trying \\nto keep his fury under control. \"Did they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner?\" \\n\"Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that,\" Ser Marq Piper snapped. He was a swaggering bantam \\nrooster of a youth, too young and too hot-blooded for Ned\\'s taste, though a fast friend of Catelyn\\'s \\nbrother, Edmure Tully. \\n\"Every man among them was mounted and mailed, my lord,\" Ser Karyl answered calmly. \"They were \\narmed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with battle-axes for the butchering.\" He gestured toward \\none of the ragged survivors. \"You. Yes, you, no one\\'s going to hurt you. Tell the Hand what you told \\nPage 310\\n\\nme.\" \\nThe old man bobbed his head. \"Concerning their horses,\" he said, \"it were warhorses they rode. Many a \\nyear I worked in old Ser Willum\\'s stables, so I knows the difference. Not a one of these ever pulled a \\nplow, gods bear witness if I\\'m wrong.\" \\n\"Well-mounted brigands,\" observed Littlefinger. \"Perhaps they stole the horses from the last place they \\nraided.\" \\n\"How many men were there in this raiding party?\" Ned asked. \\n\"A hundred, at the least,\" Joss answered, in the same instant as the bandaged smith said, \"Fifty,\" and the \\ngrandmother behind him, \"Hunnerds and hunnerds, m1ord, an army they was.\" \\n\"You are more right than you know, goodwoman,\" Lord Eddard told her. \"You say they flew no \\nbanners. What of the armor they wore? Did any of you note ornaments or decorations, devices on shield \\nor helm?\" \\nThe brewer, Joss, shook his head. \"It grieves me, m1ord, but no, the armor they showed us was plain, \\nonly . . . the one who led them, he was armored like the rest, but there was no mistaking him all the same. \\nIt was the size of him, m\\'lord. Those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one, I swear. Big as an \\nox he was, and a voice like stone breaking.\" \\n\"The Mountain!\" Ser Marq said loudly. \"Can any man doubt it? This was Gregor Clegane\\'s work.\" \\nNed heard muttering from beneath the windows and the far end of the hall. Even in the galley, nervous \\nwhispers were exchanged. High lords and smallfolk alike knew what it could mean if Ser Marq was \\nproved right. Ser Gregor Clegane stood bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. \\nHe studied the frightened faces of the villagers. Small wonder they \\nhad been so fearful; they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a red-handed \\nbutcher before a king who was his son by marriage. He wondered if the knights had given them a choice. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table, his chain of office clinking. \"Ser Marq, \\nwith respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser Gregor. There are many large men in the realm.\" \\n\"As large as the Mountain That Rides?\" Ser Karyl said. \"I have never met one.\" \\n\"Nor has any man here,\" Ser Raymun added hotly. \"Even his brother is a pup beside him. My lords, \\nopen your eyes. Do you need to see his seal on the corpses? It was Gregor.\" \\n\"Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?\" Pycelle asked. \"By the grace of his liege lord, he holds a stout \\nkeep and lands of his own. The man is an anointed knight.\" \\n\"A false knight!\" Ser Marq said. \"Lord Tywin\\'s mad dog.\" \\n\"My lord Hand,\" Pycelle declared in a stiff voice, \"I urge you to remind this good knight that Lord Tywin \\nLannister is the father of our own gracious queen.\" \\nPage 311\\n\\n\"Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle,\" Ned said. \"I fear we might have forgotten that if you had not \\npointed it out.\" \\nFrom his vantage point atop the throne, he could see men slipping out the door at the far end of the hall. \\nHares going to ground, he supposed . . . or rats off to nibble the queen\\'s cheese. He caught a glimpse of \\nSepta Mordane in the gallery, with his daughter Sansa beside her. Ned felt a flash of anger; this was no \\nplace for a girl. But the septa could not have known that today\\'s court would be anything but the usual \\ntedious business of hearing petitions, settling disputes between rival holdfasts, and adjudicating the \\nplacement of boundary stones. \\nAt the council table below, Petyr Baelish lost interest in his quill and leaned forward. \"Ser Marq, Ser \\nKaryl, Ser Raymun-perhaps I might ask you a question? These holdfasts were under your protection. \\nWhere were you when all this slaughtering and burning was going on?\" \\nSer Karyl Vance answered. \"I was attending my lord father in the pass below the Golden Tooth, as was \\nSer Marq. When the word of these outrages reached Ser Edmure Tully, he sent word that we should \\ntake a small force of men to find what survivors we could and bring them to the king.\" \\nSer Raymun Darry spoke up. \"Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun with all my strength. I was \\ncamped across the river from his walls, awaiting his commands, when the word reached me. By the time \\n1 could return to my own lands, Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for \\nLannister\\'s hills.\" \\nLittlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully. \"And if they come again, ser?\" \\n\"If they come again, we\\'ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt,\" Ser Marq Piper declared hotly. \\n\"Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day\\'s ride of the border,\" Ser Karyl \\nexplained. \"The next raider will not have such an easy time of it.\" \\nAnd that may be precisely what Lord Tywin wants, Ned thought to himself, to bleed off strength from \\nRiverrun, goad the boy into scattering his swords. His wife\\'s brother was young, and more gallant than \\nwise. He would try to hold every inch of his soil, to defend every man, woman, and child who named him \\nlord, and Tywin Lannister was shrewd enough to know that. \\n\"If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm,\" Lord Petyr was saying, \"what then do you ask of the \\nthrone?\" \\n\"The lords of the Trident keep the king\\'s peace,\" Ser Raymun Darry said. \"The Lannisters have broken \\nit. We ask leave to answer them, steel for steel. We ask justice for the smallfolk of Sherrer and Wendish \\nTown and the Mummer\\'s Ford.\" \\n\"Edmure agrees, we must pay Gregor Clegane back his bloody coin,\" Ser Marq declared, \"but old Lord \\nHoster commanded us to come here and beg the king\\'s leave before we strike.\" \\nThank the gods for old Lord Hoster, then. Tywin Lannister was as much fox as lion. If indeed he\\'d sent \\nSer Gregor to burn and pillageand Ned did not doubt that he had-he\\'d taken care to see that he rode \\nPage 312\\n\\nunder cover of night, without banners, in the guise of a common brigand. Should Riverrun strike back, \\nCersei and her father would insist that it had been the Tullys who broke the king\\'s peace, not the \\nLannisters. The gods only knew what Robert would believe. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again. \"My lord Hand, if these good folk believe that Ser Gregor \\nhas forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape, let them go to his liege lord and make their complaint. \\nThese crimes are no concern of the throne. Let them seek Lord Tywin\\'s justice.\" \\n\"It is all the king\\'s justice,\" Ned told him. \"North, south, east, or west, all we do we do in Robert\\'s \\nname.\" \\n\"The king\\'s justice,\" Grand Maester Pycelle said. \"So it is, and so we should defer this matter until the \\nking-\" \\n\"The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days,\" Lord Eddard said. \"Robert bid me to \\nsit here in his place, to listen with \\nhis ears, and to speak with his voice. I mean to do just that ... though I agree that he must be told.\" He \\nsaw a familiar face beneath the tapestries. \"Ser Robar.\" \\nSer Robar Royce stepped forward and bowed. \"My lord.\" \\n\"Your father is hunting with the king,\" Ned said. \"Will you bring them word of what was said and done \\nhere today?\" \\n\"At once, my lord.\" \\n\"Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?\" Marq Piper asked the throne. \\n\"Vengeance?\" Ned said. \"I thought we were speaking of justice. Burning Clegane\\'s fields and \\nslaughtering his people will not restore the king\\'s peace, only your injured pride.\" He glanced away \\nbefore the young knight could voice his outraged protest, and addressed the villagers. \"People of Sherrer, \\nI cannot give you back your homes or your crops, nor can I restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can \\ngive you some small measure of justice, in the name of our king, Robert.\" \\nEvery eye in the hall was fixed on him, waiting. Slowly Ned struggled to his feet, pushing himself up from \\nthe throne with the strength of his arms, his shattered leg screaming inside its cast. He did his best to \\nignore the pain; it was no moment to let them see his weakness. \"The First Men believed that the judge \\nwho called for death should wield the sword, and in the north we hold to that still. I mislike sending \\nanother to do my killing . . . yet it seems I have no choice.\" He gestured at his broken leg. \\n\"Lord Eddard!\" The shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome stripling of a boy strode \\nforth boldly. Out of his armor, Ser Loras Tyrell looked even younger than his sixteen years. He wore \\npale blue silk, his belt a linked chain of golden roses, the sigil of his House. \"I beg you the honor of acting \\nin your place. Give this task to me, my lord, and I swear I shall not fail you.\" \\nLittlefinger chuckled. \"Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will send us back your head with \\na plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours. The Mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any man\\'s \\njustice.\" \\nPage 313\\n\\n\"I do not fear Gregor Clegane,\" Ser Loras said haughtily. \\nNed eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon\\'s misshapen throne. His eyes searched \\nthe faces along the wall. \"Lord Beric,\" he called out. \"Thoros of Myr. Ser Gladden. Lord Lothar.\" The \\nmen named stepped forward one by one. \"Each of you is to assemble twenty men, to bring my word to \\nGregor\\'s keep. Twenty of my own guards shall go with you. Lord Beric Dondarrion, you shall have the \\ncommand, as befits your rank.\" \\nThe young lord with the red-gold hair bowed. \"As you command, Lord Eddard.\" \\nNed raised his voice, so it carried to the far end of the throne room. \"In the name of Robert of the \\nHouse Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of \\nthe Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, his Hand, I \\ncharge you to ride to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king\\'s \\nflag, and there bring the king\\'s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all those who shared in \\nhis crimes. I denounce him, and attaint him, and strip him of all rank and titles, of all lands and incomes \\nand holdings, and do sentence him to death. May the gods take pity on his soul.\" \\nWhen the echo of his words had died away, the Knight of Flowers seemed perplexed. \"Lord Eddard, \\nwhat of me?\" \\nNed looked down on him. From on high, Loras Tyrell seemed almost as young as Robb. \"No one \\ndoubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, and what you seek is vengeance.\" He \\nlooked back to Lord Beric. \"Ride at first light. These things are best done quickly.\" He held up a hand. \\n\"The throne will hear no more petitions today.\" \\nAlyn and Porther climbed the steep iron steps to help him back down. As they made their descent, he \\ncould feel Loras Tyrell\\'s sullen stare, but the boy had stalked away before Ned reached the floor of the \\nthrone room. \\nAt the base of the Iron Throne, Varys was gathering papers from the council table. Littlefinger and \\nGrand Maester Pycelle had already taken their leave. \"You are a bolder man than 1, my lord,\" the \\neunuch said softly. \\n\"How so, Lord Varys?\" Ned asked brusquely. His leg was throbbing, and he was in no mood for word \\ngames. \\n\"Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras. He so wanted to go . . . and a man who has the \\nLannisters for his enemies would do well to make the Tyrells his friends.\" \\n\"Ser Loras is young,\" said Ned. \"I daresay he will outgrow the disappointment.\" \\n\"And Ser Ilyn?\" The eunuch stroked a plump, powdered cheek. \"He is the King\\'s Justice, after all. \\nSending other men to do his office . . . some might construe that as a grave insult.\" \\n\"No slight was intended.\" In truth, Ned did not trust the mute knight, though perhaps that was only \\nbecause he misliked execution- \\nPage 314\\n\\ners. \"I remind you, the Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister. I thought it best to choose men who \\nowed Lord Tywin no fealty.\" \\n\"Very prudent, no doubt,\" Varys said. \"Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the back of the hall, staring at \\nus with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell \\nwith our silent knight. I hope he outgrows his disappointment as well. He does so love his work . . .\" \\nSANSA \\n\"He wouldn\\'t send Ser Loras,\" Sansa told Jeyne Poole that night as they shared a cold supper by \\nlamplight. \"I think it was because of his leg.\" \\nLord Eddard had taken his supper in his bedchamber with Alyn, Harwin, and Vayon Poole, the better to \\nrest his broken leg, and Septa Mordane had complained of sore feet after standing in the gallery all day. \\nArya was supposed to join them, but she was late coming back from her dancing lesson. \\n\"His leg?\" Jeyne said uncertainly. She was a pretty, dark-haired girl of Sansa\\'s own age. \"Did Ser Loras \\nhurt his leg?\" \\n\"Not his leg,\" Sansa said, nibbling delicately at a chicken leg. \"Father\\'s leg, silly. It hurts him ever so \\nmuch, it makes him cross. Otherwise I\\'m certain he would have sent Ser Loras.\" \\nHer father\\'s decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had spoken up, she\\'d been sure \\nshe was about to see one of Old Nan\\'s stories come to life. Ser Gregor was the monster and Ser Loras \\nthe true hero who would slay him. He even looked a true hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses \\naround his slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And then Father had \\nrefused him! It had upset her more than she could tell. She had said as much to Septa Mordane as they \\ndescended the stairs from the gallery, but the \\nsepta had only told her it was not her place to question her lord father\\'s decisions. \\nThat was when Lord Baelish had said, \"Oh, I don\\'t know, Septa. Some of her lord father\\'s decisions \\ncould do with a bit of questioning. The young lady is as wise as she is lovely.\" He made a sweeping bow \\nto Sansa, so deep she was not quite sure if she was being complimented or mocked. \\nSepta Mordane had been very upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard them. \"The girl was just \\ntalking, my lord,\" she\\'d said. \"Foolish chatter. She meant nothing by the comment.\" \\nLord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said, \"Nothing? Tell me, child, why would you have \\nsent Ser Loras?\" \\nPage 315\\n\\nSansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters. The king\\'s councillor smiled. \"Well, \\nthose are not the reasons I\\'d have given, but . . .\" He had touched her cheek, his thumb lightly tracing the \\nline of a cheekbone. \"Life is not a song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\" \\nSansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; it made her uneasy just to think back on it. \\n\"Ser Ilyn\\'s the King\\'s Justice, not Ser Loras,\" Jcyne said. \"Lord Eddard should have sent him.\" \\nSansa shuddered. Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He made her feel as though \\nsomething dead were slithering over her naked skin. \"Ser Ilyn\\'s almost like a second monster. I\\'m glad \\nFather didn\\'t pick him.\" \\n\"Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras. He\\'s ever so brave and gallant.\" \\n\"I suppose,\" Sansa said doubtfully. Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, but he was awfully old, \\nalmost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been much better. Of course, Jeyne had been in \\nlove with Lord Beric ever since she had first glimpsed him in the lists. Sansa thought she was being silly; \\nJeyne was only a steward\\'s daughter, after all, and no matter how much she mooned after him, Lord \\nBeric would never look at someone so far beneath him, even if she hadn\\'t been half his age. \\nIt would have been unkind to say so, however, so Sansa took a sip of milk and changed the subject. \"I \\nhad a dream that Jofftey would be the one to take the white hart,\" she said. It had been more of a wish, \\nactually, but it sounded better to call it a dream. Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic. White harts \\nwere supposed to be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier \\nthan his drunken father. \\n\"A dream? Truly? Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare hand and do it no harm?\" \\n\"No,\" Sansa said. \"He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me.\" In the songs, the knights \\nnever killed magical beasts, they just went up to them and touched them and did them no harm, but she \\nknew Jofftey liked hunting, especially the killing part. Only animals, though. Sansa was certain her prince \\nhad no part in murdering Jory and those other poor men; that had been his wicked uncle, the Kingslayer. \\nShe knew her father was still angry about that, but it wasn\\'t fair to blame Joff. That would be like blaming \\nher for something that Arya had done. \\n\"I saw your sister this afternoon,\" Jeyne blurted out, as if she\\'d been reading Sansa\\'s thoughts. \"She was \\nwalking through the stables on her hands. Why would she do a thing like that?\" \\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know why Arya does anything.\" Sansa hated stables, smelly places full of manure and \\nflies. Even when she went riding, she liked the boy to saddle the horse and bring it to her in the yard. \"Do \\nyou want to hear about the court or not?\" \\n\"I do,\" Jeyne said. \\n\"There-was a black brother,\" Sansa said, \"begging men for the Wall, only he was kind of old and \\nsmelly.\" She hadn\\'t liked that at all. She had always imagined the Night\\'s Watch to be men like Uncle \\nBenjen. In the songs, they were called the black knights of the Wall. But this man had been crookbacked \\nand hideous, and he looked as though he might have lice. If this was what the Night\\'s Watch was truly \\nlike, she felt sorry for her bastard half brother, Jon. \"Father asked if there were any knights in the hall \\nPage 316\\n\\nwho would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no one came forward, so he gave this \\nYoren his pick of the king\\'s dungeons and sent him on his way. And later these two brothers came before \\nhim, freeriders from the Dornish Marches, and pledged their swords to the service of the king. Father \\naccepted their oaths . . .\" \\nJeyne yawned. \"Are there any lemon cakes?\" \\nSansa did not like being interrupted, but she had to admit, lemon cakes sounded more interesting than \\nmost of what had gone on in the throne room. \"Let\\'s see,\" she said. \\nThe kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold strawberry pie, and that was almost \\nas good. They ate it on the tower steps, giggling and gossiping and sharing secrets, and Sansa went to \\nbed that night feeling almost as wicked as Arya. \\nThe next morning she woke before first light and crept sleepily to her window to watch Lord Beric form \\nup his men. They rode out as \\ndawn was breaking over the city, with three banners going before them; the crowned stag of the king \\nflew from the high staff, the direwolf of Stark and Lord Beric\\'s own forked lightning standard from \\nshorter poles. It was all so exciting, a song come to life; the clatter of swords, the flicker of torchlight, \\nbanners dancing in the wind, horses snorting and whinnying, the golden glow of sunrise slanting through \\nthe bars of the portcullis as it jerked upward. The Winterfell men looked especially fine in their silvery \\nmail and long grey cloaks. \\nAlyn carried the Stark banner. When she saw him rein in beside Lord Beric to exchange words, it made \\nSansa feel ever so proud. Alyn was handsomer than Jory had been; he was going to be a knight one day. \\nThe Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even pleased to see Arya when \\nshe went down to break her fast. \"Where is everyone?\" her sister wanted to know as she ripped the skin \\nfrom a blood orange. \"Did Father send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister?\" \\nSansa sighed. \"They rode with Lord Beric, to behead Ser Gregor Clegane.\" She turned to Septa \\nMordane, who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon. \"Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor\\'s \\nhead on his own gate or bring it back here for the king?\" She and Jeyne Poole had been arguing over that \\nlast night. \\nThe septa was horror-struck. \"A lady does not discuss such things over her porridge. Where are your \\ncourtesies, Sansa? I swear, of late you\\'ve been near as bad as your sister.\" \\n\"What did Gregor do?\" Arya asked. \\n\"He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women and children too.\" \\nArya screwed up her face in a scowl. \"Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and Heward and Wyl, and the \\nHound murdered Mycah. Somebody should have beheaded them.\" \\n\"It\\'s not the same,\" Sansa said. \"The Hound is Joffrey\\'s sworn shield. Your butcher\\'s boy attacked the \\nprince.\" \\nPage 317\\n\\n\"Liar,\" Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice oozed between her fingers. \\n\"Go ahead, call me all the names you want,\" Sansa said airily. \"You won\\'t dare when I\\'m married to \\nJoffrey. You\\'ll have to bow to me and call me Your Grace.\" She shrieked as Arya flung the orange \\nacross the table. It caught her in the middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her \\nlap. \\n\"You have juice on your face, Your Grace,\" Arya said. \\nIt was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it \\naway with a napkin. When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk dress, \\nshe shrieked again. \"You\\'re horrible,\" she screamed at her sister. \"They should have killed you instead of \\nLady!\" \\nSepta Mordane came lurching to her feet. \"Your lord father will hear of this! Go to your chambers, at \\nonce. At once!\" \\n\"Me too?\" Tears welled in Sansa\\'s eyes. \"That\\'s not fair.\" \\n\"The matter is not subject to discussion. Go!\" \\nSansa stalked away with her head up. She was to be a queen, and queens did not cry. At least not \\nwhere people could see. When she reached her bedchamber, she barred the door and took off her \\ndress. The blood orange had left a blotchy red stain on the silk. \"I hate her!\" she screamed. She balled up \\nthe dress and flung it into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night\\'s fire. When she saw that the \\nstain had bled through onto her underskirt, she began to sob despite herself. She ripped off the rest of her \\nclothes wildly, threw herself into bed, and cried herself back to sleep. \\nIt was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door. \"Sansa. Your lord father will see you \\nnow.\" \\nSansa sat up. \"Lady,\" she whispered. For a moment it was as if the direwolf was there in the room, \\nlooking at her with those golden eyes, sad and knowing. She had been dreaming, she realized. Lady was \\nwith her, and they were running together, and . . . and . . . trying to remember was like trying to catch the \\nrain with her fingers. The dream faded, and Lady was dead again. \\n\"Sansa.\" The rap came again, sharply. \"Do you hear me?\" \\n\"Yes, Septa,\" she called out. \"Might I have a moment to dress, please?\" Her eyes were red from crying, \\nbut she did her best to make herself beautiful. \\nLord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane marched her into the \\nsolar, his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table. \"Come here, Sansa,\" he said, not unkindly, when the \\nsepta had gone for her sister. \"Sit beside me.\" He closed the book. \\nSepta Mordane returned with Arya squirming in her grasp. Sansa had put on a lovely pale green damask \\ngown and a look of remorse, but her sister was still wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun she\\'d worn \\nat breakfast. \"Here is the other one,\" the septa announced. \\nPage 318\\n\\n\"My thanks, Septa Mordane. I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would be so kind.\" The septa \\nbowed and left. \\n\"Arya started it,\" Sansa said quickly, anxious to have the first word. \"She called me a liar and threw an \\norange at me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the one Queen Cersei gave me when I was betrothed \\nto \\nPrince Joffrey. She hates that I\\'m going to marry the prince. She tries to spoil everything, Father, she \\ncan\\'t stand for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid.\" \\n\"Enough, Sansa.\" Lord Eddard\\'s voice was sharp with impatience. \\nArya raised her eyes. \"I\\'m sorry, Father. I was wrong and I beg my sweet sister\\'s forgiveness.\" \\nSansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless. Finally she found her voice. \"What about \\nmy dress?\" \\n\"Maybe . . . I could wash it,\" Arya said doubtfully. \\n\"Washing won\\'t do any good,\" Sansa said. \"Not if you scrubbed all day and all night. The silk is ruined.\" \\n\"Then I\\'ll . . . make you a new one,\" Arya said. \\nSansa threw back her head in disdain. \"You? You couldn\\'t sew a dress fit to clean the pigsties.\" \\nTheir father sighed. \"I did not call you here to talk of dresses. I\\'m sending you both back to Winterfell.\" \\nFor the second time Sansa found herself too stunned for words. She felt her eyes grow moist again. \\n\"You can\\'t,\" Arya said. \\n\"Please, Father,\" Sansa managed at last. \"Please don\\'t.\" \\nEddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile. \"At last we\\'ve found something you agree on.\" \\n\"I didn\\'t do anything wrong,\" Sansa pleaded with him. \"I don\\'t want to go back.\" She loved Mng\\'s \\nLanding; the pagaentry of the court, the high lords and ladies in their velvets and silks and gemstones, the \\ngreat city with all its people. The tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life, and there \\nwas so much she had not seen yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows. She could not \\nbear the thought of losing it all. \"Send Arya away, she started it, Father, I swear it. I\\'ll be good, you\\'ll see, \\njust let me stay and I promise to be as fine and noble and courteous as the queen.\" \\nFather\\'s mouth twitched strangely. \"Sansa, I\\'m not sending you away for fighting, though the gods know \\nI\\'m sick of you two squabbling. I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety. Three of my men were \\ncut down like dogs not a league from where we sit, and what does Robert do? He goes hunting.\" \\nArya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had. \"Can we take Syrio back with us?\" \\nPage 319\\n\\n\"Who cares about your stupid dancing master?\" Sansa flared. \"Father, I only just now remembered, I \\ncan\\'t go away, I\\'m to marry Prince Joffrey.\" She tried to smile bravely for him. \"I love him, Father, I truly \\ntruly do, I love him as much as Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the \\nDragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser Florian. I want to be his queen and have his babies.\" \\n\"Sweet one,\" her father said gently, \"listen to me. When you\\'re old enough, I will make you a match with \\na high lord who\\'s worthy of you, someone brave and gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a \\nterrible mistake. That boy is no Prince Aemon, you must believe me.\" \\n\"He is!\" Sansa insisted. \"I don\\'t want someone brave and gentle, I want him. We\\'ll be ever so happy, just \\nlike in the songs, you\\'ll see. I\\'ll give him a son with golden hair, and one day he\\'ll be the king of all the \\nrealm, the greatest king that ever was, as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion.\" \\nArya made a face. \"Not if Joffrey\\'s his father,\" she said. \"He\\'s a liar and a craven and anyhow he\\'s a \\nstag, not a lion.\" \\nSansa felt tears in her eyes. \"He is not! He\\'s not the least bit like that old drunken king,\" she screamed at \\nher sister, forgetting herself in her grief. \\nFather looked at her strangely. \"Gods, \" he swore softly, \"out of the mouth of babes . . .\" He shouted for \\nSepta Mordane. To the girls he said, \"I am looking for a fast trading galley to take you home. These \\ndays, the sea is safer than the kingsroad. You will sail as soon as I can find a proper ship, with Septa \\nMordane and a complement of guards . . . and yes, with Syrio Forel, if he agrees to enter my service. \\nBut say nothing of this. It\\'s better if no one knows of our plans. We\\'ll talk again tomorrow.\" \\nSansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were going to take it all away; the \\ntournaments and the court and her prince, everything, they were going to send her back to the bleak grey \\nwalls of Winterfell and lock her up forever. Her life was over before it had begun. \\n\"Stop that weeping, child,\" Septa Mordane said sternly. \"I am certain your lord father knows what is \\nbest for you.\" \\n\"It won\\'t be so bad, Sansa,\" Arya said. \"We\\'re going to sail on a galley. It will be an adventure, and then \\nwe\\'ll be with Bran and Robb again, and Old Nan and Hodor and the rest.\" She touched her on the arm. \\n\"Hodor!\" Sansa yelled. \"You ought to marry Hodor, you\\'re just like him, stupid and hairy and ugly!\" She \\nwrenched away from her sister\\'s hand, stormed into her bedchamber, and barred the door behind her. \\nEDDARD \\n\"Pain is a gift from the gods, Lord Eddard,\" Grand Maester Pycelle told him. \"It means the bone is \\nknitting, the flesh \\nhealing itself. Be thankful.\" \\n\"I will be thankful when my leg stops throbbing.\" \\nPage 320\\n\\nPycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed. \"The milk of the poppy, for when the pain grows \\ntoo onerous.\" \\n\"I sleep too much already.\" \\n\"Sleep is the great healer.\" \\n\"I had hoped that was you.\" \\nPycelle smiled wanly. \"It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord.\" He leaned close and \\nlowered his voice. \"There was a raven this morning, a letter for the queen from her lord father. I thought \\nyou had best know.\" \\n\"Dark wings, dark words,\" Ned said grimly. \"What of it?\" \\n\"Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor Clegane,\" the maester confided. \"I \\nfeared he would be. You will recall, I said as much in council.\" \\n\"Let him be wroth,\" Ned said. Every time his leg throbbed, he remembered Jaime Lannister\\'s smile, and \\nJory dead in his arms. \"Let him write all the letters to the queen he likes. Lord Beric rides beneath the \\nking\\'s own banner. If Lord Tywin attempts to interfere with the king\\'s justice, he will have Robert to \\nanswer to. The only thing His \\nGrace enjoys more than hunting is making war on lords who defy him.\" \\nPycelle pulled back, his maester\\'s chain jangling. \"As you say. I shall visit again on the morrow.\" The old \\nman hurriedly gathered up his things and took his leave. Ned had little doubt that he was bound straight \\nfor the royal apartments, to whisper at the queen. I thought you had best know, indeed . . . as if Cersei \\nhad not instructed him to pass along her father\\'s threats. He hoped his response rattled those perfect \\nteeth of hers. Ned was not near as confident of Robert as he pretended, but there was no reason Cersei \\nneed know that. \\nWhen Pycelle was gone, Ned called for a cup of honeyed wine. That clouded the mind as well, yet not \\nas badly. He needed to be able to think. A thousand times, he asked himself what Jon Arryn might have \\ndone, had he lived long enough to act on what he\\'d learned. Or perhaps he had acted, and died for it. \\nIt was queer how sometimes a child\\'s innocent eyes can see things that grown men are blind to. \\nSomeday, when Sansa was grown, he would have to tell her how she had made it all come clear for him. \\nHe\\'s not the least bit like that old drunken king, she had declared, angry and unknowing, and the simple \\ntruth of it had twisted inside him, cold as death. This was the sword that killed Jon Anyn, Ned thought \\nthen, and it will kill Robert as well, a slower death but full as certain. Shattered legs may heal in time, but \\nsome betrayals fester and poison the soul. \\nLittlefinger came calling an hour after the Grand Maester had left, clad in a plum-colored doublet with a \\nmockingbird embroidered on the breast in black thread, and a striped cloak of black and white. \"I cannot \\nvisit long, my lord,\" he announced. \"Lady Tanda expects me to lunch with her. No doubt she will roast \\nme a fatted calf. If it\\'s near as fatted as her daughter, I\\'m like to rupture and die. And how is your leg?\" \\nPage 321\\n\\n\"Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad.\" \\nLittlefinger lifted an eyebrow. \"In future, try not to let any horses fall on it. I would urge you to heal \\nquickly. The realm grows restive. Varys has heard ominous whispers from the west. Freeriders and \\nsellswords have been flocking to Casterly Rock, and not for the thin pleasure of Lord Tywin\\'s \\nconversation.\" \\n\"Is there word of the king?\" Ned demanded. \"Just how long does Robert intend to hunt?\" \\n\"Given his preferences, I believe he\\'d stay in the forest until you and the queen both die of old age,\" Lord \\nPetyr replied with a faint smile. \"Lacking that, I imagine he\\'ll return as soon as he\\'s killed something. They \\nfound the white hart, it seems . . . or rather, what remained \\nof it. Some wolves found it first, and left His Grace scarcely more than a hoof and a horn. \\nRobert was in a fury, until he heard talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest. Then nothing \\nwould do but he must have it. Prince Joffrey returned this morning, with the Royces, Ser Balon Swann, \\nand some twenty others of the party. The rest are still with the king.\" \\n\"The Hound?\" Ned asked, frowning. Of all the Lannister party, Sandor Clegane was the one who \\nconcerned him the most, now that Ser Jaime had fled the city to join his father. \\n\"Oh, returned with Joffrey, and went straight to the queen.\" Littlefinger smiled. \"I would have given a \\nhundred silver stags to have been a roach in the rushes when he learned that Lord Beric was off to \\nbehead his brother.\" \\n\"Even a blind man could see the Hound loathed his brother.\" \\n\"Ah, but Gregor was his to loathe, not yours to kill. Once Dondarrion lops the summit off our Mountain, \\nthe Clegane lands and incomes will pass to Sandor, but I wouldn\\'t hold my water waiting for his thanks, \\nnot that one. And now you must forgive me. Lady Tanda awaits with her fatted calves.\" \\nOn the way to the door, Lord Petyr spied Grand Maester Malleon\\'s massive tome on the table and \\npaused to idly flip open the cover. \"The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven \\nKingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children, \" he read. \\n\"Now there is tedious reading if ever I saw it. A sleeping potion, my lord?\" \\nFor a brief moment Ned considered telling him all of it, but there was something in Littlefinger\\'s japes \\nthat irked him. The man was too clever by half, a mocking smile never far from his lips. \"Jon Arryn was \\nstudying this volume when he was taken sick,\" Ned said in a careful tone, to see how he might respond. \\nAnd he responded as he always did: with a quip. \"In that case,\" he said, \"death must have come as a \\nblessed relief.\" Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took his leave. \\nEddard Stark allowed himself a curse. Aside from his own retainers, there was scarcely a man in this city \\nhe trusted. Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped Ned in his inquiries, yet his haste to save his \\nown skin when Jaime and his swords had come out of the rain still rankled. Varys was worse. For all his \\nprotestations of loyalty, the eunuch knew too much and did too little. Grand Maester Pycelle seemed \\nmore Cersei\\'s creature with every passing day, and Ser Barristan was an old man, and rigid. He would \\ntell Ned to do his duty. \\nPage 322\\n\\nTime was perilously short. The king would return from his hunt \\nsoon, and honor would require Ned to go to him with all he had learned. Vayon Poole had arranged for \\nSansa and Arya to sail on the Wind Witch out of Braavos, three days hence. They would be back at \\nWinterfell before the harvest. Ned could no longer use his concern for their safety to excuse his delay. \\nYet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar\\'s children. Lord Tywin had laid the bodies beneath the Iron \\nThrone, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. That was clever of him; the blood did not \\nshow so badly against the red cloth. The little princess had been barefoot, still dressed in her bed gown, \\nand the boy . . . the boy . . . \\nNed could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second mad king, another dance \\nof blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save the children. \\nRobert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had pardoned. Grand Maester \\nPycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had been counted an enemy to Robert once, and \\neach had been welcomed into friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty. \\nSo long as a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect due a \\nvaliant enemy. \\nThis was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This he could never forgive, no \\nmore than he had forgiven Rhaegar. He will kill them all, Ned realized. \\nAnd yet, he knew he could not keep silent. He had a duty to Robert, to the realm, to the shade of Jon \\nArryn . . . and to Bran, who surely must have stumbled on some part of the truth. Why else would they \\nhave tried to slay him? \\nLate that afternoon he summoned Tomard, the portly guardsman with the ginger-colored whiskers his \\nchildren called Fat Tom. With Jory dead and Alyn gone, Fat Tom had command of his household guard. \\nThe thought filled Ned with vague disquiet. Tomard was a solid man; affable, loyal, tireless, capable in a \\nlimited way, but he was near fifty, and even in his youth he had never been energetic. Perhaps Ned \\nshould not have been so quick to send off half his guard, and all his best swords among them. \\n\"I shall require your help,\" Ned said when Tomard appeared, looking faintly apprehensive, as he always \\ndid when called before his lord. \"Take me to the godswood.\" \\n\"Is that wise, Lord Eddard? With your leg and all?\" \\n\"Perhaps not. But necessary.\" \\nTomard summoned Varly. With one arm around each man\\'s shoulders, Ned managed to descend the \\nsteep tower steps and hobble across \\nthe bailey. \"I want the guard doubled,\" he told Fat Tom. \"No one enters or leaves the Tower of the \\nHand without my leave.\" \\nPage 323\\n\\nTom blinked. \"NI\\'lord, with Alyn and the others away, we are hardpressed already-\" \\n\"It will only be a short while. Lengthen the watches.\" \\n\"As you say, m\\'lord,\" Tom answered. \"Might I ask why-\" \\n\"Best not,\" Ned answered crisply. \\nThe godswood was empty, as it always was here in this citadel of the southron gods. Ned\\'s leg was \\nscreaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart tree. \"Thank you.\" He drew a paper from his \\nsleeve, sealed with the sigil of his House. \"Kindly deliver this at once.\" \\nTomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips anxiously. \"My lord . . .\" \\n\"Do as I bid you, Tom,\" Ned said. \\nHow long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was peaceful here. The thick \\nwalls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear birds singing, the murmur of crickets, leaves \\nrustling in a gentle wind. The heart tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the \\npresence of his gods. His leg did not seem to hurt so much. \\nShe came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. She came alone, as he \\nhad bid her. For once she was dressed simply, in leather boots and hunting greens. When she drew back \\nthe hood of her brown cloak, he saw the bruise where the king had struck her. The angry plum color had \\nfaded to yellow, and the swelling was down, but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it was. \\n\"Why here?\" Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him. \\n\"So the gods can see.\" \\nShe sat beside him on the grass. Her every move was graceful. Her curling blond hair moved in the \\nwind, and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer. It had been a long time since Ned Stark had \\nseen her beauty, but he saw it now. \"I know the truth Jon Arryn died for,\" he told her. \\n\"Do you?\" The queen watched his face, wary as a cat. \"Is that why you called me here, Lord Stark? To \\npose me riddles? Or is it your intent to seize me, as your wife seized my brother?\" \\n\"If you truly believed that, you would never have come.\" Ned touched her cheek gently. \"Has he done \\nthis before?\" \\n\"Once or twice.\" She shied away from his hand. \"Never on the face before. Jaime would have killed him, \\neven if it meant his own life.\" \\nCersei looked at him defiantly. \"My brother is worth a hundred of your friend.\" \\n\"Your brother?\" Ned said. \"Or your lover?\" \\n\"Both.\" She did not flinch from the truth. \"Since we were children together. And why not? The \\nTargaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years, to keep the bloodlines pure. And Jaime and I \\nPage 324\\n\\nare more than brother and sister. We are one person in two bodies. We shared a womb together. He \\ncame into this world holding my foot, our old maester said. When he is in me, I feel . . . whole.\" The \\nghost of a smile flitted over her lips. \\n\"My son Bran . . .\" \\nTo her credit, Cersei did not look away. \"He saw us. You love your children, do you not?\" \\nRobert had asked him the very same question, the morning of the melee. He gave her the same answer. \\n\"With all my heart.\" \\n\"No less do I love mine.\" \\nNed thought, If it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against Robb and Sansa and Arya \\nand Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, what would Catelyn do, if it were Jon\\'s life, \\nagainst the children of her body? He did not know. He prayed he never would. \\n\"All three are Jaime\\'s,\" he said. It was not a question. \\n\"Thank the gods.\" \\nThe seed is strong, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and so it was. All those bastards, all with hair \\nas black as night. Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion, some ninety \\nyears ago, when Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon, third son of the reigning lord. Their only issue, an \\nunnamed boy described in Malleon\\'s tome as a large and lusty lad born with a full head of black hair, \\ndied in infancy. Thirty years before that a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon maid to wife. She had \\ngiven him three daughters and a son, each black-haired. No matter how far back Ned searched in the \\nbrittle yellowed pages, always he found the gold yielding before the coal. \\n\"A dozen years,\" Ned said. \"How is it that you have had no children by the king?\" \\nShe lifted her head, defiant. \"Your Robert got me with child once,\" she said, her voice thick with \\ncontempt. \"My brother found a woman to cleanse me. He never knew, If truth be told, I can scarcely \\nbear for him to touch me, and I have not let him inside me for years. I know other ways to pleasure him, \\nwhen he leaves his whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber. Whatever we do, the king is \\nusually so drunk that he\\'s forgotten it all by the next morning.\" \\nHow could they have all been so blind? The truth was there in front \\nof them all the time, written on the children\\'s faces. Ned felt sick. \"I remember Robert as he was the day \\nhe took the throne, every inch a king,\" he said quietly. \"A thousand other women might have loved him \\nwith all their hearts. What did he do to make you hate him so?\" \\nHer eyes burned, green fire in the dusk, like the lioness that was her sigil. \"The night of our wedding \\nfeast, the first time we shared a bed, he called me by your sister\\'s name. He was on top of me, in me, \\nstinking of wine, and he whispered Lyanna. \" \\nNed Stark thought of pale blue roses, and for a moment he wanted to weep. \"I do not know which of \\nyou I pity most.\" \\nPage 325\\n\\nThe queen seemed amused by that. \"Save your pity for yourself, Lord Stark. I want none of it.\" \\n\"You know what I must do.\" \\n\"Must?\" She put her hand on his good leg, just above the knee. \"A true man does what he will, not what \\nhe must.\" Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh, the gentlest of promises. \"The realm needs a strong \\nHand. Joff will not come of age for years. No one wants war again, least of all me.\" Her hand touched his \\nface, his hair. \"If friends can turn to enemies, enemies can become friends. Your wife is a thousand \\nleagues away, and my brother has fled. Be kind to me, Ned. I swear to you, you shall never regret it.\" \\n\"Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn?\" \\nShe slapped him. \\n\"I shall wear that as a badge of honor,\" Ned said dryly. \\n\"Honor, \" she spat. \"How dare you play the noble lord with me! What do you take me for? You\\'ve a \\nbastard of your own, I\\'ve seen him. Who was the mother, I wonder? Some Dornish peasant you raped \\nwhile her holdfast burned? A whore? Or was it the grieving sister, the Lady Ashara? She threw herself \\ninto the sea, I\\'m told. Why was that? For the brother you slew, or the child you stole? Tell me, my \\nhonorable Lord Eddard, how are you any different from Robert, or me, or Jaime?\" \\n\"For a start,\" said Ned, \"I do not kill children. You would do well to listen, my lady. I shall say this only \\nonce. When the king returns from his hunt, I intend to lay the truth before him. You must be gone by then. \\nYou and your children, all three, and not to Casterly Rock. If I were you, I should take ship for the Free \\nCities, or even farther, to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben. As far as the winds blow.\" \\n\"Exile,\" she said. \"A bitter cup to drink from.\" \\n\"A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegar\\'s children,\" Ned said, \"and kinder than you deserve. \\nYour father and your brothers would do well to go with you. Lord Tywin\\'s gold will buy you comfort \\nand hire swords to keep you safe. You shall need them. I promise you, no matter where you flee, \\nRobert\\'s wrath will follow you, to the back of beyond if need be.\" \\nThe queen stood. \"And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?\" she asked softly. Her eyes searched his face. \\n\"You should have taken the realm for yourself. It was there for the taking. Jaime told me how you found \\nhim on the Iron Throne the day King\\'s Landing fell, and made him yield it up. That was your moment. All \\nyou needed to do was climb those steps, and sit. Such a sad mistake.\" \\n\"I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine,\" Ned said, \"but that was not one of them.\" \\n\"Oh, but it was, my lord,\" Cersei insisted. \"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. \\nThere is no middle ground.\" \\nShe turned up her hood to hide her swollen face and left him there in the dark beneath the oak, amidst \\nthe quiet of the godswood, under a blue-black sky. The stars were coming out. \\nPage 326\\n\\nDAENERYS \\nThe heart was steaming in the cool evening air when Khal Drogo set it before her, raw and bloody. His \\narms were red to the elbow. Behind him, his bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of the wild \\nstallion, stone knives in their hands. The stallion\\'s blood looked black in the flickering orange glare of the \\ntorches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit. \\nDany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled down her brow. She could \\nfeel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as \\npolished flint in their wrinkled faces. She must not flinch or look afraid. I am the blood of the dragon, she \\ntold herself as she took the stallion\\'s heart in both hands, lifted it to her mouth, and plunged her teeth into \\nthe tough, stringy flesh. \\nWarm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened to gag her, but she made \\nherself chew and swallow. The heart of a stallion would make her son strong and swift and fearless, or so \\nthe Dothraki believed, but only if the mother could eat it all. If she choked on the blood or retched up the \\nflesh, the omens were less favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, deformed, or \\nfemale. \\nHer handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the tender mother\\'s stomach that \\nhad afflicted her these past \\ntwo moons, Dany had dined on bowls of half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri \\nmade her chew strips of dried horseflesh until her jaws were aching. She had starved herself for a day \\nand a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would help her keep down the raw meat. \\nThe wild stallion\\'s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it with her teeth and chew each mouthful \\na long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred confines of Vaes Dothrak, beneath the shadow of \\nthe Mother of Mountains; she had to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails. Her stomach roiled and \\nheaved, yet she kept on, her face smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode \\nagainst her lips. \\nKhal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face as hard as a bronze shield. His long black braid was \\nshiny with oil. He wore gold rings in his mustache, gold bells in his braid, and a heavy belt of solid gold \\nmedallions around his waist, but his chest was bare. She looked at him whenever she felt her strength \\nfailing; looked at him, and chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed. \\nToward the end, Dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almondshaped eyes, but she could \\nnot be sure. The khal\\'s face did not often betray the thoughts within. \\nAnd finally it was done. Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced down the last of it. Only then \\ndid she turn her eyes back to the old women, the crones of the dosh khaleen. \\n\"Khalakka dothrae mranha!\" she proclaimed in her best Dothraki. A prince tides inside me! She had \\npracticed the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui. \\nThe oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single black eye, raised her arms \\non high. \"Khalakka dothrae!\" she shrieked. The prince is tiding! \\nPage 327\\n\\n\"He is tiding!\" the other women answered. \"Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!\" they proclaimed. A boy, a boy, a \\nstrong boy. \\nBells rang, a sudden clangor of bronze birds. A deep-throated warhorn sounded its long low note. The \\nold women began to chant. Underneath their painted leather vests, their withered dugs swayed back and \\nforth, shiny with oil and sweat. The eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great \\nbronze brazier, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up toward the moon and the stars. The Dothraki \\nbelieved the stars were horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped across the sky by night. \\nAs the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed her single eye, the better \\nto peer into the future. The \\nsilence that fell was complete. Dany could hear the distant call of night birds, the hiss and crackle of the \\ntorches, the gentle lapping of water from the lake. The Dothraki stared at her with eyes of night, waiting. \\nKhal Drogo laid his hand on Dany\\'s arm. She could feel the tension in his fingers. Even a khal as mighty \\nas Drogo could know fear when the dosh khaleen peered into smoke of the future. At her back, her \\nhandmaids fluttered anxiously. \\nFinally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms. \"I have seen his face, and heard the thunder of his \\nhooves,\" she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice. \\n\"The thunder of his hooves!\" the others chorused. \\n\"As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his khalasar covers the earth, men without number, with \\narakhs shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. Fierce as a storm this prince will be. His enemies \\nwill tremble before him, and their wives will weep tears of blood and rend their flesh in grief. The bells in \\nhis hair will sing his coming, and the milk men in the stone tents will fear his name.\" The old woman \\ntrembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid. \"The prince is riding, and he shall be the \\nstallion who mounts the world.\" \\n\"The stallion who mounts the world!\" the onlookers cried in echo, until the night rang to the sound of \\ntheir voices. \\nThe one-eyed crone peered at Dany. \"What shall he be called, the stallion who mounts the world?\" \\nShe stood to answer. \"He shall be called Rhaego,\" she said, using the words that Jhiqui had taught her. \\nHer hands touched the swell beneath her breasts protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki. \\n\"Rhaego, \" they screamed. \"Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!\" \\nThe name was still ringing in her ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit. His bloodriders fell in behind \\nthem. A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the broad grassy road that ran through the \\nheart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of the dosh khaleen \\ncame first, with their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they \\nstruggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old \\nwomen had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took his place at the \\nfront of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were sent here, to reign over the vast \\nDothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. \\nPage 328\\n\\nStill, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or \\nno. \\nBehind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the \\nkhalakka Fogo, Khal Jommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo\\'s khalasar, Dany\\'s handmaids, the \\nkhal\\'s servants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a stately cadence as they marched along \\nthe godsway. Stolen heroes and the gods of dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond the road. \\nAlongside the procession, slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands, and the \\nflickering flames made the great monuments seem almost alive. \\n\"What is meaning, name Rhaego?\" Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using the Common Tongue of the \\nSeven Kingdoms. She had been teaching him a few words when she could. Drogo was quick to learn \\nwhen he put his mind to it, though his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor \\nViserys could understand a word he said. \\n\"My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,\" she told him. \"He died before I was born. \\nSer Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons.\" \\nKhal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet under the long black mustache, \\ndrooping beneath the weight of its gold rings, she thought she glimpsed the shadow of a smile. \"Is good \\nname, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life,\" he said. \\nThey rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded by a fringe of reeds, its \\nwater still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui told her, the first man had emerged from its \\ndepths, riding upon the back of the first horse. \\nThe procession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled clothing fall to the ground. \\nNaked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud \\nsquishing between her toes as she pushed through the tall reeds. The moon floated on the still black \\nwaters, shattering and re-forming as her ripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin as \\nthe coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion\\'s blood had dried on her hands \\nand around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted the sacred waters over her head, cleansing \\nherself and the child inside her while the khal and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the \\ndosh khaleen muttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying. \\nWhen she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid Doreah hurried to her with a \\nrobe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her away. He was looking on her swollen breasts and \\nthe curve of her belly with approval, and Dany could see the shape of his manhood pressing through his \\nhorsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of his belt. She went to him and helped him unlace. \\nThen her huge khal took her by the hips and lifted her into the air, as he might lift a child. The bells in his \\nhair rang softly. \\nDany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his neck as he thrust himself \\ninside her. Three quick strokes and it was done. \"The stallion who mounts the world, \" Drogo whispered \\nhoarsely. His hands still smelled of horse blood. He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of his pleasure, \\nPage 329\\n\\nand when he lifted her off, his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs. Only then was \\nDoreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft slippers to her feet. \\nKhal Drogo laced himself up and spoke a command, and horses were brought to the lakeshore. Cohollo \\nhad the honor of helping the khaleesi onto her silver. Drogo spurred his stallion, and set off down the \\ngodsway beneath the moon and stars. On her silver, Dany easily kept pace. \\nThe silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo\\'s hall had been rolled up tonight, and the moon followed them \\ninside. Flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge stone-lined firepits. The air was thick with the \\nsmells of roasting meat and curdled, fermented mare\\'s milk. The hall was crowded and noisy when they \\nentered, the cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow them at the \\nceremony. As Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle, every eye was on her. The \\nDothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her breasts, hailing the life within her. She could not \\nunderstand all they shouted, but one phrase came clear. \"The stallion that mounts the world, \" she heard, \\nbellowed in a thousand voices. \\nThe sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night. Halfclothed women spun and danced on the \\nlow tables, amid joints of meat and platters piled high with plums and dates and pomegranates. Many of \\nthe men were drunk on clotted mare\\'s milk, yet Dany knew no arakhs would clash tonight, not here in the \\nsacred city, where blades and bloodshed were forbidden. \\nKhal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench. Khal Jommo and Khal Ogo, who had \\nbeen in Vaes Dothrak with their khalasars when they arrived, were given seats of high honor to Drogo\\'s \\nright and left. The bloodriders of the three khals sat below them, and farther down Khal Jommo\\'s four \\nwives. \\nDany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves. As Doreah and Irri arranged her \\ncushions, she searched for her brother. Even across the length of the crowded hall, Viserys should have \\nbeen conspicuous with his pale skin, silvery hair, and beggar\\'s rags, but she did not see him anywhere. \\nHer glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose braids were even shorter than \\ntheir manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions around the low tables, but all the faces she saw had \\nblack eyes and copper skin. She spied Ser Jorah Mormont near the center of the hall, close to the middle \\nfirepit. It was a place of respect, if not high honor; the Dothraki esteemed the knight\\'s prowess with a \\nsword. Dany sent Jhiqui to bring him to her table. Mormont came at once, and went to one knee before \\nher. \"Khaleesi, \" he said, \"I am yours to command.\" \\nShe patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her. \"Sit and talk with me.\" \\n\"You honor me.\" The knight seated himself cross-legged on the cushion. A slave knelt before him, \\noffering a wooden platter full of ripe figs. Ser Jorah took one and bit it in half. \\n\"Where is my brother?\" Dany asked. \"He ought to have come by now, for the feast.\" \\n\"I saw His Grace this morning,\" he told her. \"He told me he was going to the Western Market, in search \\nof wine.\" \\n\"Wine?\" Dany said doubtfully. Viserys could not abide the taste of the fermented mare\\'s milk the \\nDothraki drank, she knew that, and he was oft at the bazaars these days, drinking with the traders who \\nPage 330\\n\\ncame in the great caravans from east and west. He seemed to find their company more congenial than \\nhers. \\n\"Wine,\" Ser Jorah confirmed, \"and he has some thought to recruit men for his army from the sellswords \\nwho guard the caravans.\" A serving girl laid a blood pie in front of him, and he attacked it with both \\nhands. \\n\"Is that wise?\" she asked. \"He has no gold to pay soldiers. What if he\\'s betrayed?\" Caravan guards were \\nseldom troubled much by thoughts of honor, and the Usurper in King\\'s Landing would pay well for her \\nbrother\\'s head. \"You ought to have gone with him, to keep him safe. You are his sworn sword.\" \\n\"We are in Vaes Dothrak,\" he reminded her. \"No one may carry a blade here or shed a man\\'s blood.\" \\n\"Yet men die,\" she said. \"Jhogo told me. Some of the traders have eunuchs with them, huge men who \\nstrangle thieves with wisps of silk. That way no blood is shed and the gods are not angered.\" \\n\"Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything.\" Ser Jorah wiped the grease off \\nhis mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close over the table. \"He had planned to take your \\ndragon\\'s eggs, until I warned him that I\\'d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them.\" \\nFor a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words. \"My eggs ... but they\\'re mine, Magister Illyrio \\ngave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys want . . . they\\'re only stones . . .\" \\n\"The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, Princess . . . and dragon\\'s eggs are rarer \\nby far. Those traders he\\'s been drinking with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those \\nstones, and with all three Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need.\" \\nDany had not known, had not even suspected. \"Then . . . he should have them. He does not need to \\nsteal them. He had only to ask. He is my brother . . . and my true king.\" \\n\"He is your brother,\" Ser Jorah acknowledged. \\n\"You do not understand, ser,\" she said. \"My mother died giving me birth, and my father and my brother \\nRhaegar even before that. I would never have known so much as their names if Viserys had not been \\nthere to tell me. He was the only one left. The only one. He is all I have.\" \\n\"Once,\" said Ser Jorah. \"No longer, Khaleesi. You belong to the Dothraki now. In your womb rides the \\nstallion who mounts the world.\" He held out his cup, and a slave filled it with fermented mare\\'s milk, \\nsour-smelling and thick with clots. \\nDany waved her away. Even the smell of it made her feel ill, and she would take no chances of bringing \\nup the horse heart she had forced herself to eat. \"What does it mean?\" she asked. \"What is this stallion? \\nEveryone was shouting it at me, but I don\\'t understand.\" \\n\"The stallion is the khal of khals promised in ancient prophecy, child. He will unite the Dothraki into a \\nsingle khalasar and ride to the ends of the earth, or so it was promised. All the people of the world will \\nbe his herd.\" \\n\"Oh,\" Dany said in a small voice. Her hand smoothed her robe down over the swell of her stomach. \"I \\nPage 331\\n\\nnamed him Rhaego.\" \\n\"A name to make the Usurper\\'s blood run cold.\" \\nSuddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow. \"My lady, \" the handmaid whispered urgently, \"your brother \\n. . .\" \\nDany looked down the length of the long, roofless hall and there he was, striding toward her. From the \\nlurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys had found his wine . . . and something that passed for \\ncourage. \\nHe was wearing his scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained. His cloak and gloves were black velvet, \\nfaded from the sun. His boots were dry and cracked, his silver-blond hair matted and tangled. A \\nlongsword \\nswung from his belt in a leather scabbard. The Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed; Dany heard \\ncurses and threats and angry muttering rising all around her, like a tide. The music died away in a nervous \\nstammering of drums. \\nA sense of dread closed around her heart. \"Go to him,\" she commanded Ser Jorah. \"Stop him. Bring him \\nhere. Tell him he can have the dragon\\'s eggs if that is what he wants.\" The knight rose swiftly to his feet. \\n\"Where is my sister?\" Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine. \"I\\'ve come for her feast. How dare you \\npresume to eat without me? No one eats before the king. Where is she? The whore can\\'t hide from the \\ndragon.\" \\nHe stopped beside the largest of the three firepits, peering around at the faces of the Dothraki. There \\nwere five thousand men in the hall, but only a handful who knew the Common Tongue. Yet even if his \\nwords were incomprehensible, you had only to look at him to know that he was drunk. \\nSer Jorah went to him swiftly, whispered something in his ear, and took him by the arm, but Viserys \\nwrenched free. \"Keep your hands off me! No one touches the dragon without leave.\" \\nDany glanced anxiously up at the high bench. Khal Drogo was saying something to the other khals \\nbeside him. Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began to guffaw loudly. \\nThe sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes. \"Khal Drogo,\" he said thickly, his voice almost polite. \\n\"I\\'m here for the feast.\" He staggered away from Ser Jorah, making to join the three khals on the high \\nbench. \\nKhal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could understand, and pointed. \\n\"Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,\" Ser Jorah translated for her brother. \"Khal Drogo \\nsays your place is there.\" \\nViserys glanced where the khal was pointing. At the back of the long hall, in a corner by the wall, deep \\nin shadow so better men would not need to look on them, sat the lowest of the low; raw unblooded \\nboys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff joints, the dim-witted and the maimed. Far from the meat, and \\nfarther from honor. \"That is no place for a king,\" her brother declared. \\nPage 332\\n\\n\"Is place,\" Khal Drogo answered, in the Common Tongue that Dany had taught him, \"for Sorefoot \\nKing.\" He clapped his hands together. \"A cart! Bring cart for Khal Rhaggat! \" \\nFive thousand Dothraki began to laugh and shout. Ser Jorah was \\nstanding beside Viserys, screaming in his ear, but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that Dany could \\nnot hear what he was saying. Her brother shouted back and the two men grappled, until Mormont \\nknocked Viserys bodily to the floor. \\nHer brother drew his sword. \\nThe bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits. \"Keep away from me!\" Viserys hissed. \\nSer Jorah backed off a step, and her brother climbed unsteadily to his feet. He waved the sword over his \\nhead, the borrowed blade that Magister Illyrio had given him to make him seem more kingly. Dothraki \\nwere shrieking at him from all sides, screaming vile curses. \\nDany gave a wordless cry of terror. She knew what a drawn sword meant here, even if her brother did \\nnot. \\nHer voice made Viserys turn his head, and he saw her for the first time. \"There she is,\" he said, smiling. \\nHe stalked toward her, slashing at the air as if to cut a path through a wall of enemies, though no one \\ntried to bar his way. \\n\"The blade . . . you must not,\" she begged him. \"Please, Viserys. It is forbidden. Put down the sword \\nand come share my cushions. There\\'s drink, food . . . is it the dragon\\'s eggs you want? You can have \\nthem, only throw away the sword.\" \\n\"Do as she tells you, fool,\" Ser Jorah shouted, \"before you get us all killed.\" \\nViserys laughed. \"They can\\'t kill us. They can\\'t shed blood here in the sacred city . . . but I can.\" He laid \\nthe point of his sword between Daenerys\\'s breasts and slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. \"I \\nwant what I came for,\" he told her. \"I want the crown he promised me. He bought you, but he never paid \\nfor you. Tell him I want what I bargained for, or I\\'m taking you back. You and the eggs both. He can \\nkeep his bloody foal. I\\'ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.\" The sword point pushed through her \\nsilks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same \\ntime, this man who had once been her brother. \\nDistantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, pleading that she dared not \\ntranslate, that the khal would bind her and drag her behind his horse all the way up the Mother of \\nMountains. She put her arm around the girl. \"Don\\'t be afraid,\" she said. \"I shall tell him.\" \\nShe did not know if she had enough words, yet when she was done Khal Drogo spoke a few brusque \\nsentences in Dothraki, and she knew he understood. The sun of her life stepped down from the high \\nbench. \\n\"What did he say?\" the man who had been her brother asked her, flinching. \\nPage 333\\n\\nIt had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in Khal Drogo\\'s hair, chiming softly with \\neach step he took. His bloodriders followed him, like three copper shadows. Daenerys had gone cold all \\nover. \"He says you shall have a splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.\" \\nViserys smiled and lowered his sword. That was the saddest thing, the thing that tore at her afterward . . \\n. the way he smiled. \"That was all I wanted,\" he said. \"What was promised.\" \\nWhen the sun of her life reached her, Dany slid an arm around his waist. The khal said a word, and his \\nbloodriders leapt forward. Qotho seized the man who had been her brother by the arms. Haggo \\nshattered his wrist with a single, sharp twist of his huge hands. Cohollo pulled the sword from his limp \\nfingers. Even now Viserys did not understand. \"No,\" he shouted, \"you cannot touch me, I am the dragon, \\nthe dragon, and I will be crowned!\" \\nKhal Drogo unfastened his belt. The medallions were pure gold, massive and ornate, each one as large \\nas a man\\'s hand. He shouted a command. Cook slaves pulled a heavy iron stew pot from the firepit, \\ndumped the stew onto the ground, and returned the pot to the flames. Drogo tossed in the belt and \\nwatched without expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose their shape. She could see \\nfires dancing in the onyx of his eyes. A slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair mittens, and he pulled \\nthem on, never so much as looking at the man. \\nViserys began to scream the high, wordless scream of the coward facing death. He kicked and twisted, \\nwhimpered like a dog and wept like a child, but the Dothraki held him tight between them. Ser Jorah had \\nmade his way to Dany\\'s side. He put a hand on her shoulder. \"Turn away, my princess, I beg you.\" \\n\"No.\" She folded her arms across the swell of her belly, protectively. \\nAt the last, Viserys looked at her. \"Sister, please . . . Dany, tell them . . . make them . . . sweet sister . . \\n.\" \\nWhen the gold was half-melted and starting to run, Drogo reached into the flames, snatched out the pot. \\n\"Crown!\" he roared. \"Here. A crown for Cart King!\" And upended the pot over the head of the man \\nwho had been her brother. \\nThe sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his face was like nothing \\nhuman. His feet hammered a frantic \\nbeat against the dirt floor, slowed, stopped. Thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto his chest, \\nsetting the scarlet silk to smoldering . . . yet no drop of blood was spilled. \\nHe was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon. \\nEDDARD \\nHe was walking through the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he hhad walked a thousand times before. The \\nKings of Winter atched him pass with eyes of ice, and the direwolves at their feet turned their great stone \\nheads and snarled. Last of all, he came to the tomb where his father slept, with Brandon and Lyanna \\nbeside him. \"Promise me, Ned, \" Lyanna\\'s statue whispered. She wore a garland of pale blue roses, and \\nPage 334\\n\\nher eyes wept blood. \\nEddard Stark jerked upright, his heart racing, the blankets tangled around him. The room was black as \\npitch, and someone was hammering on the door. \"Lord Eddard,\" a voice called loudly. \\n\"A moment.\" Groggy and naked, he stumbled his way across the darkened chamber. When he opened \\nthe door, he found Tomard with an upraised fist, and Cayn with a taper in hand. Between them stood the \\nking\\'s own steward. \\nThe man\\'s face might have been carved of stone, so little did it show. \"My lord Hand,\" he intoned. \"His \\nGrace the King commands your presence. At once.\" \\nSo Robert had returned from his hunt. It was long past time. \"I shall need a few moments to dress.\" Ned \\nleft the man waiting without. Cayn helped him with his clothes; white linen tunic and grey cloak, trousers \\ncut open down his plaster-sheathed leg, his badge of office, and last of \\nall a belt of heavy silver links. He sheathed the Valyrian dagger at his waist. \\nThe Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the inner bailey. The moon \\nhung low over the walls, ripening toward full. On the ramparts, a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his \\nrounds. \\nThe royal apartments were in Maegor\\'s Holdfast, a massive square fortress that nestled in the heart of \\nthe Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry moat lined with iron spikes, a \\ncastle-within-acastle. Ser Boros Blount guarded the far end of the bridge, white steel armor ghostly in the \\nmoonlight. Within, Ned passed two other knights of the Kingsguard; Ser Preston Greenfield stood at the \\nbottom of the steps, and Ser Barristan Selmy waited at the door of the king\\'s bedchamber. Three men in \\nwhite cloaks, he thought, remembering, and a strange chill went through him. Ser Barristan\\'s face was as \\npale as his armor. Ned had only to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong. The royal \\nsteward opened the door. \"Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the King,\" he announced. \\n\"Bring him here,\" Robert\\'s voice called, strangely thick. \\nFires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber, filling the room with a sullen red glare. \\nThe heat within was suffocating. Robert lay across the canopied bed. At the bedside hovered Grand \\nMaester Pycelle, while Lord Renly paced restlessly before the shuttered windows. Servants moved back \\nand forth, feeding logs to the fire and boiling wine. Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed beside her \\nhusband. Her hair was tousled, as if from sleep, but there was nothing sleepy in her eyes. They followed \\nNed as Tomard and Cayn helped him cross the room. He seemed to move very slowly, as if he were still \\ndreaming. \\nThe king still wore his boots. Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass clinging to the leather where \\nRobert\\'s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that covered him, A green doublet lay on the floor, slashed \\nopen and discarded, the cloth crusted with red-brown stains. The room smelled of smoke and blood and \\ndeath. \\n\"Ned,\" the king whispered when he saw him. His face was pale as milk. \"Come . . . closer.\" \\nHis men brought him close. Ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost. He had only to look down \\nPage 335\\n\\nat Robert to know how bad it was. \"What . . . ?\" he began, his throat clenched. \\n\"A boar.\" Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with blood. \\n\"A devil,\" the king husked. \"My own fault. Too much wine, damn me to hell. Missed my thrust.\" \\n\"And where were the rest of you?\" Ned demanded of Lord Renly. \"Where was Ser Barristan and the \\nKingsguard?\" \\nRenly\\'s mouth twitched. \"My brother commanded us to stand aside and let him take the boar alone.\" \\nEddard Stark lifted the blanket. \\nThey had done what they could to close him up, but it was nowhere near enough. The boar must have \\nbeen a fearsome thing. It had ripped the king from groin to nipple with its tusks. The wine-soaked \\nbandages that Grand Maester Pycelle had applied were already black with blood, and the smell off the \\nwound was hideous. Ned\\'s stomach turned. He let the blanket fall. \\n\"Stinks,\" Robert said. \"The stink of death, don\\'t think I can\\'t smell it. Bastard did me good, eh? But I . . . \\nI paid him back in kind, Ned.\" The king\\'s smile was as terrible as his wound, his teeth red. \"Drove a knife \\nright through his eye. Ask them if I didn\\'t. Ask them.\" \\n\"Truly,\" Lord Renly murmured. \"We brought the carcass back with us, at my brother\\'s command.\" \\n\"For the feast,\" Robert whispered. \"Now leave us. The lot of you. I need to speak with Ned.\" \\n\"Robert, my sweet lord Cersei began. \\n\"I said leave,\" Robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness. \"What part of that don\\'t you understand, \\nwoman?\" \\nCersei gathered up her skirts and her dignity and led the way to the door. Lord Renly and the others \\nfollowed. Grand Maester Pycelle lingered, his hands shaking as he offered the king a cup of thick white \\nliquid. \"The milk of the poppy, Your Grace,\" he said. \"Drink. For your pain.\" \\nRobert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand. \"Away with you. I\\'ll sleep soon enough, old \\nfool. Get out.\" \\nGrand Maester Pycelle gave Ned a stricken look as he shuffled from the room. \\n\"Damn you, Robert,\" Ned said when they were alone. His leg was throbbing so badly he was almost \\nblind with pain. Or perhaps it was grief that fogged his eyes. He lowered himself to the bed, beside his \\nfriend. \"Why do you always have to be so headstrong?\" \\n\"Ah, fuck you, Ned,\" the king said hoarsely. \"I killed the bastard, didn\\'t IT\\' A lock of matted black hair \\nfell across his eyes as he glared up at Ned. \"Ought to do the same for you. Can\\'t leave a man to hunt in \\npeace. Ser Robar found me. Gregor\\'s head. Ugly thought. Never told the Hound. Let Cersei surprise \\nhim.\" His laugh turned into a grunt as \\nPage 336\\n\\na spasm of pain hit him. \"Gods have mercy,\" he muttered, swallowing his agony. \"The girl. Daenerys. \\nOnly a child, you were right ... that\\'s why, the girl . . . the gods sent the boar . . . sent to punish me . . .\" \\nThe king coughed, bringing up blood. \"Wrong, it was wrong, I . . . only a girl . . . Varys, Littlefinger, even \\nmy brother . . . worthless . . . no one to tell me no but you, Ned . . . only you . . .\" He lifted his hand, the \\ngesture pained and feeble. \"Paper and ink. There, on the table. Write what I tell you.\" \\nNed smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill. \"At your command, Your Grace.\" \\n\"This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and \\nall the rest-put in the damn titles, you know how it goes. I do hereby command Eddard of House Stark, \\nLord of Winterfell and Hand of the King, to serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my . \\n. . upon my death . . . to rule in my . . . in my stead, until my son Joffrey does come of age . . . \\n\"Robert Joffirey is not your son, he wanted to say, but the words would not come. The agony was \\nwritten too plainly across Robert\\'s face; he could not hurt him more. So Ned bent his head and wrote, \\nbut where the king had said \"my son Joffrey,\" he scrawled \"my heir\" instead. The deceit made him feel \\nsoiled. The lies we tellfor love, he thought. May the gods forgive me. \"What else would you have me \\nsay?\" \\n\"Say . . . whatever you need to. Protect and defend, gods old and new, you have the words. Write. I\\'ll \\nsign it. You give it to the council when I\\'m dead.\" \\n\"Robert,\" Ned said in a voice thick with grief, \"you must not do this. Don\\'t die on me. The realm needs \\nyou.\" \\nRobert took his hand, fingers squeezing hard. \"You are . . . such a bad liar, Ned Stark,\" he said through \\nhis pain. \"The realm . . . the realm knows . . . what a wretched king I\\'ve been. Bad as Aerys, the gods \\nspare me.\" \\n\"No,\" Ned told his dying friend, \"not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace. Not near so bad as Aerys.\" \\nRobert managed a weak red smile. \"At the least, they will say . . . this last thing . . . this I did right. You \\nwon\\'t fail me. You\\'ll rule now. You\\'ll hate it, worse than I did . . . but you\\'ll do well. Are you done with \\nthe scribbling?\" \\n\"Yes, Your Grace.\" Ned offered Robert the paper. The king scrawled his signature blindly, leaving a \\nsmear of blood across the letter. \"The seal should be witnessed.\" \\n\"Serve the boar at my funeral feast,\" Robert rasped. \"Apple in its mouth, skin seared crisp. Eat the \\nbastard. Don\\'t care if you choke on him. Promise me, Ned.\" \\n\"I promise.\" Promise me, Ned, Lyanna\\'s voice echoed. \\n\"The girl,\" the king said. \"Daenerys. Let her live. If you can, if it . . . not too late . . . talk to them . . . \\nVarys, Littlefinger . . . don\\'t let them kill her. And help my son, Ned. Make him be . . . better than me.\" \\nHe winced. \"Gods have mercy.\" \\nPage 337\\n\\n\"They will, my friend,\" Ned said. \"They will.\" \\nThe king closed his eyes and seemed to relax. \"Killed by a pig,\" he muttered. \"Ought to laugh, but it \\nhurts too much.\" \\nNed was not laughing. \"Shall I call them back?\" \\nRobert gave a weak nod. \"As you will. Gods, why is it so cold in here?\" \\nThe servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the fires. The queen had gone; that was some small \\nrelief, at least. If she had any sense, Cersei would take her children and fly before the break of day, Ned \\nthought. She had lingered too long already. \\nKing Robert did not seem to miss her. He bid his brother Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle to stand in \\nwitness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax that Ned had dripped upon his letter. \"Now give \\nme something for the pain and let me die.\" \\nHurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of the poppy. This time the king \\ndrank deeply. His black beard was beaded with thick white droplets when he threw the empty cup aside. \\n\"Will I dream?\" \\nNed gave him his answer. \"You will, my lord.\" \\n\"Good,\" he said, smiling. \"I will give Lyanna your love, Ned. Take care of my children for me.\" \\nThe words twisted in Ned\\'s belly like a knife. For a moment he was at a loss. He could not bring himself \\nto lie. Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at her mother\\'s breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at \\nhis forge, and all the others. \"I shall . . . guard your children as if they were my own,\" he said slowly. \\nRobert nodded and closed his eyes. Ned watched his old friend sag softly into the pillows as the milk of \\nthe poppy washed the pain from his face. Sleep took him. \\nHeavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned. \"I will do all in my power, my \\nlord, but the wound has mortified. It took them two days to get him back. By the time I saw him, it was \\ntoo late. I can lessen His Grace\\'s suffering, but only the gods can heal him now.\" \\n\"How long?\" Ned asked. \\n\"By rights, he should be dead already. I have never seen a man cling to life so fiercely.\" \\n\"My brother was always strong,\" Lord Renly said. \"Not wise, perhaps, but strong.\" In the sweltering \\nheat of the bedchamber, his brow was slick with sweat. He might have been Robert\\'s ghost as he stood \\nthere, young and dark and handsome. \"He slew the boar. His entrails were sliding from his belly, yet \\nsomehow he slew the boar.\" His voice was full of wonder. \\n\"Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained standing,\" Ned told him. \\nOutside the door, Ser Barristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs. \"Maester Pycelle has given Robert \\nthe milk of the poppy,\" Ned told him. \"See that no one disturbs his rest without leave from me.\" \\nPage 338\\n\\n\" It shall be as you command, my lord.\" Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his years. \"I have failed my \\nsacred trust.\" \\n\"Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself,\" Ned said. \"Robert loved to hunt boar. I \\nhave seen him take a thousand of them.\" He would stand his ground without flinching, his legs braced, the \\ngreat spear in his hands, and as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged, and wait until the last \\npossible second, until it was almost on him, before he killed it with a single sure and savage thrust. \"No \\none could know this one would be his death.\" \\n\"You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.\" \\n\"The king himself said as much. He blamed the wine.\" \\nThe white-haired knight gave a weary nod. \"His Grace was reeling in his saddle by the time we flushed \\nthe boar from his lair, yet he commanded us all to stand aside.\" \\n\" I wonder, Ser Barristan,\" asked Varys, so quietly, \"who gave the king this wine?\" \\nNed had not heard the eunuch approach, but when he looked around, there he stood. He wore a black \\nvelvet robe that brushed the floor, and his face was freshly powdered. \\n\"The wine was from the king\\'s own skin,\" Ser Barristan said. \\n\"Only one skin? Hunting is such thirsty work.\" \\n\"I did not keep count. More than one, for a certainty. His squire would fetch him a fresh skin whenever \\nhe required it.\" \\n\"Such a dutiful boy,\" said Varys, \"to make certain His Grace did not lack for refreshment.\" \\nNed had a bitter taste in his mouth. He recalled the two fair-haired boys Robert had sent chasing after a \\nbreastplate stretcher. The king \\nhad told everyone the tale that night at the feast, laughing until he shook. \"Which squire?\" \\n\"The elder,\" said Ser Barristan. \"Lancel.\" \\n\"I know the lad well,\" said Varys. \"A stalwart boy, Ser Kevan Lannister\\'s son, nephew to Lord Tywin \\nand cousin to the queen. I hope the dear sweet lad does not blame himself. Children are so vulnerable in \\nthe innocence of their youth, how well do I remember.\" \\nCertainly Varys had once been young. Ned doubted that he had ever been innocent. \"You mention \\nchildren. Robert had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen. Whatever arrangements you \\nmade, I want unmade. At once.\" \\n\"Alas,\" said Varys. \"At once may be too late. I fear those birds have flown. But I shall do what I can, my \\nlord. With your leave.\" He bowed and vanished down the steps, his soft-soled slippers whispering \\nagainst the stone as he made his descent. \\nPage 339\\n\\nCayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the bridge when Lord Renly emerged from Maegor\\'s \\nHoldfast. \"Lord Eddard,\" he called after Ned, \"a moment, if you would be so kind.\" \\nNed stopped. \"As you wish.\" \\nRenly walked to his side. \"Send your men away.\" They met in the center of the bridge, the dry moat \\nbeneath them. Moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the spikes that lined its bed. \\nNed gestured. Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away respectfully. Lord Renly glanced \\nwarily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span, at Ser Preston in the doorway behind them. \"That letter.\" \\nHe leaned close. \"Was it the regency? Has my brother named you Protector?\" He did not wait for a \\nreply. \"My lord, I have thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and lords. Give \\nme an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.\" \\n\"And what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?\" \\n\"Strike! Now, while the castle sleeps.\" Renly looked back at Ser Boros again and dropped his voice to \\nan urgent whisper. \"We must get Joffrey away from his mother and take him in hand. Protector or no, the \\nman who holds the king holds the kingdom. We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well. Once we \\nhave her children, Cersei will not dare oppose us. The council will confirm you as Lord Protector and \\nmake Joffrey your ward.\" \\nNed regarded him coldly. \"Robert is not dead yet. The gods may spare him. If not, I shall convene the \\ncouncil to hear his final words and consider the matter of the succession, but I will not dishonor his last \\nhours on earth by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.\" \\nLord Renly took a step back, taut as a bowstring. \"Every moment you delay gives Cersei another \\nmoment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it may be too late . . . for both of us.\" \\n\"Then we should pray that Robert does not die.\" \\n\"Small chance of that,\" said Renly. \\n\"Sometimes the gods are merciful.\" \\n\"The Lannisters are not.\" Lord Renly turned away and went back across the moat, to the tower where \\nhis brother lay dying. \\nBy the time Ned returned to his chambers, he felt weary and heartsick, yet there was no question of his \\ngoing back to sleep, not now. When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die, Cersei Lannister \\nhad told him in the godswood. He found himself wondering if he had done the right thing by refusing Lord \\nRenly\\'s offer. He had no taste for these intrigues, and there was no honor in threatening children, and yet . \\n. . if Cersei elected to fight rather than flee, he might well have need of Renly\\'s hundred swords, and more \\nbesides. \\n\"I want Littlefinger,\" he told Cayn. \"If he\\'s not in his chambers, take as many men as you need and \\nsearch every winesink and whorehouse in King\\'s Landing until you find him. Bring him to me before \\nbreak of day.\" Cayn bowed and took his leave, and Ned turned to Tomard. \"The Wind Witch sails on \\nPage 340\\n\\nthe evening tide. Have you chosen the escort?\" \\n\"Ten men, with Porther in command.\" \\n\"Twenty, and you will command,\" Ned said. Porther was a brave man, but headstrong. He wanted \\nsomeone more solid and sensible to keep watch over his daughters. \\n\"As you wish, m\\'lord,\" Tom said. \"Can\\'t say I\\'ll be sad to see the back of this place. I miss the wife.\" \\n\"You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north. I need you to deliver a letter for me.\" \\nTom looked apprehensive. \"To Dragonstone, m\\'lord?\" The island fortress of House Targaryen had a \\nsinister repute. \\n\"Tell Captain Qos to hoist my banner as soon as he comes in sight of the island. They may be wary of \\nunexpected visitors. If he is reluctant, offer him whatever it takes. I will give you a letter to place into the \\nhand of Lord Stannis Baratheon. No one else. Not his steward, nor the captain of his guard, nor his lady \\nwife, but only Lord Stannis himself.\" \\n\"As you command, m1ord.\" \\nWhen Tomard had left him, Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the candle that burned beside \\nhim on the table. For a moment his grief overwhelmed him. He wanted nothing so much as to seek out \\nthe godswood, to kneel before the heart tree and pray for the life of Robert Baratheon, who had been \\nmore than a brother to him. Men would whisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed his king\\'s \\nfriendship and disinherited his sons; he could only hope that the gods would know better, and that Robert \\nwould learn the truth of it in the land beyond the grave. \\nNed took out the king\\'s last letter. A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with golden wax, a few short \\nwords and a smear of blood. How small the difference between victory and defeat, between life and \\ndeath. \\nHe drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot. To His Grace, Stannis of the \\nHouse Baratheon, he wrote. By the time you receive this letter, your brother Robert, our King these past \\nfifteen years, will be dead. He was savaged by a boar whilst hunting in the kingswood . . . \\nThe letters seemed to writhe and twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a stop. Lord Tywin and Ser \\nJaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly; they would fight rather than flee. No doubt Lord Stannis \\nwas wary, after the murder of Jon Arryn, but it was imperative that he sail for King\\'s Landing at once \\nwith all his power, before the Lannisters could march. \\nNed chose each word with care. When he was done, he signed the letter Eddard Stark, Lord of \\nWinterfell, Hand of the King, and Protector of the Realm, blotted the paper, folded it twice, and melted \\nthe sealing wax over the candle flame. \\nHis regency would be a short one, he reflected as the wax softened. The new king would choose his \\nown Hand. Ned would be free to go home. The thought of Winterfell brought a wan smile to his face. He \\nwanted to hear Bran\\'s laughter once more, to go hawking with Robb, to watch Rickon at play. He \\nPage 341\\n\\nwanted to drift off to a dreamless sleep in his own bed with his arms wrapped tight around his lady, \\nCatelyn. \\nCayn returned as he was pressing the direwolf seal down into the soft white wax. Desmond was with \\nhim, and between them Littlefinger. Ned thanked his guards and sent them away. \\nLord Petyr was clad in a blue velvet tunic with puffed sleeves, his silvery cape patterned with \\nmockingbirds. \"I suppose congratulations are in order,\" he said as he seated himself. \\nNed scowled. \"The king lies wounded and near to death.\" \\n\"I know,\" Littlefinger said. \"I also know that Robert has named you Protector of the Realm.\" \\nNed\\'s eyes flicked to the king\\'s letter on the table beside him, its seal unbroken. \"And how is it you \\nknow that, my lord?\" \\n\"Varys hinted as much,\" Littlefinger said, \"and you have just confirmed it.\" \\nNed\\'s mouth twisted in anger. \"Damn Varys and his little birds. Catelyn spoke truly, the man has some \\nblack art. I do not trust him.\" \\n\"Excellent. You\\'re learning.\" Littlefinger leaned forward. \"Yet I\\'ll wager you did not drag me here in the \\nblack of night to discuss the eunuch.\" \\n\"No,\" Ned admitted. \"I know the secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect. Robert will leave no \\ntrueborn son behind him. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannister\\'s bastards, born of his incestuous \\nunion with the queen.\" \\nLittlefinger lifted an eyebrow. \"Shocking,\" he said in a tone that suggested he was not shocked at all. \\n\"The girl as well? No doubt. So when the king dies . . .\" \\n\"The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Robert\\'s two brothers.\" \\nLord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter. \"So it would seem. Unless . . .\" \\n\"Unless, my lord? There is no seeming to this. Stannis is the heir. Nothing can change that.\" \\n\" Stannis cannot take the throne without your help. If you\\'re wise, you\\'ll make certain Joffrey succeeds.\" \\nNed gave him a stony stare. \"Have you no shred of honor?\" \\n\"Oh, a shred, surely,\" Littlefinger replied negligently. \"Hear me out. Stannis is no friend of yours, nor of \\nmine. Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him. The man is iron, hard and unyielding. He\\'ll give us a \\nnew Hand and a new council, for a certainty. No doubt he\\'ll thank you for handing him the crown, but he \\nwon\\'t love you for it. And his ascent will mean war. Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne until Cersei \\nand her bastards are dead. Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while his daughter\\'s head is measured \\nfor a spike? Casterly Rock will rise, and not alone. Robert found it in him to pardon men who served \\nKing Aerys, so long as they did him fealty. Stannis is less forgiving. He will not have forgotten the siege of \\nStorm\\'s End, and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dare not. Every man who fought beneath the dragon \\nPage 342\\n\\nbanner or rose with Balon Greyjoy will have good cause to fear. Seat Stannis on the Iron Throne and I \\npromise you, the realm will bleed. \\n\"Now look at the other side of the coin. Joffrey is but twelve, and Robert gave you the regency, my lord. \\nYou are the Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm. The power is yours, Lord Stark. All you need \\ndo is reach out and take it. Make your peace with the Lannisters. Release the Imp. Wed Joffrey to your \\nSansa. Wed your younger girl to \\nPrince Tommen, and your heir to Myrcella. It will be four years before Joffrey comes of age. By then he \\nwill look to you as a second father, and if not, well . . . four years is a good long while, my lord. Long \\nenough to dispose of Lord Stannis. Then, should Joffrey prove troublesome, we can reveal his little \\nsecret and put Lord Renly on the throne.\" \\n\"We?\" Ned repeated. \\nLittlefinger gave a shrug. \"You\\'ll need someone to share your burdens. I assure you, my price would be \\nmodest.\" \\n\"Your price.\" Ned\\'s voice was ice. \"Lord Baelish, what you suggest is treason.\" \\n\"Only if we lose.\" \\n\"You forget,\" Ned told him. \"You forget Jon Arryn. You forget Jory Cassel. And you forget this.\" He \\ndrew the dagger and laid it on the table between them; a length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel, as \\nsharp as the difference between right and wrong, between true and false, between life and death. \"They \\nsent a man to cut my son\\'s throat, Lord Baelish.\" \\nLittlefinger sighed. \"I fear I did forget, my lord. Pray forgive me. For a moment I did not remember that I \\nwas talking to a Stark.\" His mouth quirked. \"So it will be Stannis, and war?\" \\n\"It is not a choice. Stannis is the heir.\" \\n\"Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector. What would you have of me, then? Not my wisdom, \\nfor a certainty.\" \\n\"I shall do my best to forget your . . . wisdom,\" Ned said with distaste. \"I called you here to ask for the \\nhelp you promised Catelyn. This is a perilous hour for all of us. Robert has named me Protector, true \\nenough, but in the eyes of the world, Joffrey is still his son and heir. The queen has a dozen knights and a \\nhundred men-at-arms who will do whatever she commands . . . enough to overwhelm what remains of \\nmy own household guard. And for all I know, her brother Jaime may be riding for King\\'s Landing even \\nas we speak, with a Lannister host at his back.\" \\n\"And you without an army.\" Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, turning it slowly with a finger. \\n\"There is small love lost between Lord Renly and the Lannisters. Bronze Yohn Royce, Ser Balon Swann, \\nSer Loras, Lady Tanda, the Redwyne twins . . . each of them has a retinue of knights and sworn swords \\nhere at court.\" \\n\"Renly has thirty men in his personal guard, the rest even fewer. It is not enough, even if I could be \\ncertain that all of them will choose to give me their allegiance. I must have the gold cloaks. The City \\nPage 343\\n\\nWatch is \\ntwo thousand strong, sworn to defend the castle, the city, and the king\\'s peace.\" \\n\"Ah, but when the queen proclaims one king and the Hand another, whose peace do they protect?\" \\nLord Petyr flicked at the dagger with his finger, setting it spinning in place. Round and round it went, \\nwobbling as it turned. When at last it slowed to a stop, the blade pointed at Littlefinger. \"Why, there\\'s \\nyour answer,\" he said, smiling. \"They follow the man who pays them.\" He leaned back and looked Ned \\nfull in the face, his grey-green eyes bright with mockery. \"You wear your honor like a suit of armor, \\nStark. You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is weigh you down and make it hard for you to move. \\nLook at you now. You know why you summoned me here. You know what you want to ask me to do. \\nYou know it has to be done . . . but it\\'s not honorable, so the words stick in your throat.\" \\nNed\\'s neck was rigid with tension. For a moment he was so angry that he did not trust himself to speak. \\nLittlefinger laughed. \"I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel . . . so have no fear, my good \\nlord. For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to Janos Slynt this very hour and make certain \\nthat the City Watch is yours. Six thousand gold pieces should do it. A third for the Commander, a third \\nfor the officers, a third for the men. We might be able to buy them for half that much, but I prefer not to \\ntake chances.\" Smiling, he plucked up the dagger and offered it to Ned, hilt first. \\nJON \\nJon was breaking his fast on applecakes and blood sausage when Samwell Tarly plopped himself down \\non the bench. \"I\\'ve been summoned to the sept,\" Sam said in an excited whisper. \"They\\'re passing me out \\nof training. I\\'m to be made a brother with the rest of you. Can you believe it?\" \\n\"No, truly?\" \\n\"Truly. I\\'m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds. He needs someone who can read and \\nwrite letters.\" \\n\"You\\'ll do well at that,\" Jon said, smiling. \\nSam glanced about anxiously. \"Is it time to go? I shouldn\\'t be late, they might change their minds.\" He \\nwas fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn courtyard. The day was warm and sunny. Rivulets \\nof water trickled down the sides of the Wall, so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine. \\nInside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed through the south-facing window \\nand spread it in a rainbow on the altar. Pyp\\'s mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and \\nToad poked Grenn in the ribs, but no one dared say a word. Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, \\nfilling the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark\\'s little sept in Winterfell. For once the \\nsepton seemed sober. \\nThe high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on \\nPage 344\\n\\nClydas, Ser Alliser cold-eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool \\ndoublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings. Behind them came the senior members of the three orders: \\nred-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who \\ncommanded the rangers in the absence of Benjen Stark. \\nMormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head. \"You came to us outlaws,\" \\nhe began, \"poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves. You came to us children. You came to us \\nalone, in chains, with neither friends nor honor. You came to us rich, and you came to us poor. Some of \\nyou bear the names of proud houses. Others have only bastards\\' names, or no names at all. It makes no \\nmatter. All that is past now. On the Wall, we are all one house. \\n\"At evenfall, as the sun sets and we face the gathering night, you shall take your vows. From that \\nmoment, you will be a Sworn Brother of the Night\\'s Watch. Your crimes will be washed away, your \\ndebts forgiven. So too you must wash away your former loyalties, put aside your grudges, forget old \\nwrongs and old loves alike. Here you begin anew. \\n\"A man of the Night\\'s Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, nor a lord, nor the honor of this \\nhouse or that house, neither for gold nor glory nor a woman\\'s love, but for the realm, and all the people in \\nit. A man of the Night\\'s Watch takes no wife and fathers no sons. Our wife is duty. Our mistress is honor. \\nAnd you are the only sons we shall ever know. \\n\"You have learned the words of the vow. Think carefully before you say them, for once you have taken \\nthe black, there is no turning back. The penalty for desertion is death.\" The Old Bear paused for a \\nmoment before he said, \"Are there any among you who wish to leave our company? If so, go now, and \\nno one shall think the less of you.\" \\nNo one moved. \\n\"Well and good,\" said Mormont. \"You may take your vows here at evenfall, before Septon Celladar and \\nthe first of your order. Do any of you keep to the old gods?\" \\nJon stood. \"I do, my lord.\" \\n\"I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle did,\" Mormont said. \\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Jon said. The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the blood of the First Men \\nflowed in the veins of the Starks. \\nHe heard Grenn whispering behind him. \"There\\'s no godswood here. Is there? I never saw a \\ngodswood.\" \\n\"You wouldn\\'t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,\" Pyp whispered back. \\n\"I would so,\" Grenn insisted. \"I\\'d see them a long way off.\" \\nMormont himself confirmed Grenn\\'s doubts. \"Castle Black has no need of a godswood. Beyond the \\nWall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, long before the Andals brought the Seven \\nacross the narrow sea. You will find a grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your \\nPage 345\\n\\ngods as well.\" \\n\"My lord.\" The voice made Jon glance back in surprise. Samwell Tarly was on his feet. The fat boy \\nwiped his sweaty palms against his tunic. \"Might I . . . might I go as well? To say my words at this heart \\ntree?\" \\n\"Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?\" Mormont asked. \\n\"No, my lord,\" Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice. The high officers frightened him, Jon knew, the Old \\nBear most of all. \"I was named in the light of the Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his \\nfather, and all the Tarlys for a thousand years.\" \\n\"Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?\" wondered Ser Jaremy Rykker. \\n\"The Night\\'s Watch is my House now,\" Sam said. \"The Seven have never answered my prayers. \\nPerhaps the old gods will.\" \\n\"As you wish, boy,\" Mormont said. Sam took his seat again, as did Jon. \"We have placed each of you in \\nan order, as befits our need and your own strengths and skills.\" Bowen Marsh stepped forward and \\nhanded him a paper. The Lord Commander unrolled it and began to read. \"Haider, to the builders,\" he \\nbegan. Haider gave a stiff nod of approval. \"Grenn, to the rangers. Albett, to the builders. Pypar, to the \\nrangers.\" Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears. \"Samwell, to the stewards.\" Sam sagged with \\nrelief, mopping at his brow with,a scrap of silk. \"Matthar, to the rangers. Dareon, to the stewards. \\nTodder, to the rangers. Jon, to the stewards.\" \\nThe stewards? For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard. Mormont must have read it \\nwrong. He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them there had been a mistake . . . and then he saw \\nSer Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as two flakes of obsidian, and he knew. \\nThe Old Bear rolled up the paper. \"Your firsts will instruct you in your duties. May all the gods preserve \\nyou, brothers.\" The Lord Commander favored them with a half bow, and took his leave. Ser Alliser went \\nwith him, a thin smile on his face. Jon had never seen the masterat-arms took quite so happy. \\n\"Rangers with me,\" Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone. \\nPyp was staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet. His ears were red. Grenn, grinning broadly, did not \\nseem to realize that anything was amiss. Matt and Toad fell in beside them, and they followed Ser Jaremy \\nfrom the sept. \\n\"Builders,\" announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck. Haider and Albett trailed out after him. \\nJon looked around him in sick disbelief. Maester Aemon\\'s blind eyes were raised toward the light he \\ncould not see. The septon was arranging crystals on the altar. Only Sam and Darcon remained on the \\nbenches; a fat boy, a singer . . . and him. \\nLord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together. \"Samwell, you will assist Maester \\nAemon in the rookery and library. Chett is going to the kennels, to help with the hounds. You shall have \\nhis cell, so as to be close to the maester night and day. I trust you will take good care of him. He is very \\nold and very precious to us. \\nPage 346\\n\\n\"Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord\\'s table and shared their meat and mead. We are \\nsending you to Eastwatch. It may be your palate will be some help to Cotter Pyke when merchant galleys \\ncome trading. We are paying too dear for salt beef and pickled fish, and the quality of the olive oil we\\'re \\ngetting has been frightful, Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive, he will keep you busy between \\nships.\" \\nMarsh turned his smile on Jon. \"Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward, \\nJon. You\\'ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the Lord Commander\\'s tower.\" \\n\"And what will my duties be?\" Jon asked sharply. \"Will I serve the Lord Commander\\'s meals, help him \\nfasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?\" \\n.\"Certainly.\" Marsh frowned at Jon\\'s tone. \"And you will run his messages, keep a fire burning in his \\nchambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all else that the Lord Commander might require \\nof YOU.\" \\n\"Do you take me for a servant?\" \\n\"No,\" Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him stand. \"We took you for a \\nman of Night\\'s Watch . . . but perhaps we were wrong in that.\" \\nIt was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out. Was he supposed to churn butter and sew \\ndoublets like a girl for the rest of his days? \"May I go?\" he asked stiffly. \\n\"As you wish,\" Bowen Marsh responded. \\nDareon and Sam left with him. They descended to the yard in silence. Outside, Jon looked up at the \\nWall shining in the sun, the \\nmelting ice creeping down its side in a hundred thin fingers. Jon\\'s rage was such that he would have \\nsmashed it all in an instant, and the world be damned. \\n\"Jon,\" Samwell Tarly said excitedly. \"Wait. Don\\'t you see what they\\'re doing?\" \\nJon turned on him in a fury. \"I see Ser Alliser\\'s bloody hand, that\\'s all I see. He wanted to shame me, \\nand he has.\" \\nDareon gave him a look. \"The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, Sam, but not for Lord \\nSnow.\" \\n\"I\\'m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you,\" Jon blazed back. \"It\\'s notfair!\" \\n\"Fair?\" Dareon sneered. \"The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she was born. She pulled me \\nthrough the window, and you talk to me of fair?\" He walked off. \\n\"There is no shame in being a steward,\" Sam said. \\n\"Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man\\'s smallclothes?\" \\nPage 347\\n\\n\"The old man is Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch,\" Sam reminded him. \"You\\'ll be with him day \\nand night. Yes, you\\'ll pour his wine and see that his bed linen is fresh, but you\\'ll also take his letters, \\nattend him at meetings, squire for him in battle. You\\'ll be as close to him as his shadow. You\\'ll know \\neverything, be a part of everything . . . and the Lord Steward said Mormont asked for you himself! \\n\"When I was little, my father used to insist that I attend him in the audience chamber whenever he held \\ncourt. When he rode to Highgarden to bend his knee to Lord Tyrell, he made me come. Later, though, \\nhe started to take Dickon and leave me at home, and he no longer cared whether I sat through his \\naudiences, so long as Dickon was there. He wanted his heir at his side, don\\'t you see? To watch and \\nlisten and learn from all he did. I\\'ll wager that\\'s why Lord Mormont requested you, Jon. What else could \\nit be? He wants to groom you for command!\" \\nJon was taken aback. It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of his councils back at \\nWinterfell. Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high in the Night\\'s Watch, they said. \"I never \\nasked for this,\" he said stubbornly. \\n\"None of us are here for asking,\" Sam reminded him. \\nAnd suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed. \\nCraven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a man. On the Wall, a man \\ngets only what he earns, Benjen Stark had said the last night Jon had seen him alive. You\\'re no ranger, \\nJon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you. He\\'d heard it \\nsaid that bastards grow up faster than other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died. \\nJon let out a deep sigh. \"You have the right of it. I was acting the boy.,, \\n\"Then you\\'ll stay and say your words with me?\" \\n\"The old gods will be expecting us.\" He made himself smile. \\nThey set out late that afternoon. The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at Castle Black nor \\nanywhere along its three hundred miles. They led their horses down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, \\ncold dark walls pressing in around them as the passage twisted and turned. Three times their way was \\nblocked by iron bars, and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the \\nmassive chains that secured them. Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on him as he waited \\nbehind the Lord Steward. The air was colder than a tomb, and more still. He felt a strange relief when \\nthey reemerged into the afternoon light on the north side of the Wall. \\nSam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively. \"The wildlings . . . they wouldn\\'t . . . \\nthey\\'d never dare come this close to the Wall. Would they?\" \\n\"They never have.\" Jon climbed into his saddle. When Bowen Marsh and their ranger escort had \\nmounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled. Ghost came loping out of the tunnel. \\nThe Lord Steward\\'s garron whickered and backed away from the direwolf. \"Do you mean to take that \\nbeast?\" \\nPage 348\\n\\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Jon said. Ghost\\'s head lifted. He seemed to taste the air. In the blink of an eye he was \\noff, racing across the broad, weedchoked field to vanish in the trees. \\nOnce they had entered the forest, they were in a different world. Jon had often hunted with his father and \\nJory and his brother Robb. He knew the wolfswood around Winterfell as well as any man. The haunted \\nforest was much the same, and yet the feel of it was very different. \\nPerhaps it was all in the knowing. They had ridden past the end of the world; somehow that changed \\neverything. Every shadow seemed darker, every sound more ominous. The trees pressed close and shut \\nout the light of the setting sun. A thin crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses, with a \\nsound like breaking bones. When the wind set the leaves to rustling, it was like a chilly finger tracing a \\npath up Jon\\'s spine. The Wall was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay ahead. \\nThe sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a small clearing in the deep of \\nthe wood where nine weirwoods \\ngrew in a rough circle. Jon drew in a breath, and be saw Sam Tarly staring. Even in the wolfswood, you \\nnever found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove of nine was unheard of. \\nThe forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred on top, black rot beneath. The wide smooth \\ntrunks were bone pale, and nine faces stared inward. The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and \\nhard as ruby. Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle. \"This is a sacred \\nplace, we will not defile it.\" \\nWhen they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each face in turn. No two were \\nquite alike. \"They\\'re watching us,\" he whispered. \"The old gods.\" \\n\"Yes.\" Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him. \\nThey said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day became black night. \\n\"Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow,\" they recited, their voices filling the twilit grove. \"Night \\ngathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, \\nfather no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. f am the \\nsword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light \\nthat brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge \\nmy life and honor to the Night\\'s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.\" \\nThe woods fell silent. \"You knelt as boys,\" Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly. \"Rise now as men of the \\nNight\\'s Watch.\" \\nJon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet. The rangers gathered round to offer smiles and \\ncongratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen. \"Best we be starting back, m\\'lord,\" he said to \\nBowen Marsh. \"Dark\\'s falling, and there\\'s something in the smell o\\' the night that I mislike.\" \\nAnd suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods. White fur and red eyes, Jon \\nrealized, disquieted. Like the trees . . . \\nThe wolf had something in his jaws. Something black. \"What\\'s he got there?\" asked Bowen Marsh, \\nPage 349\\n\\nfrowning. \\n\"To me, Ghost.\" Jon knelt. \"Bring it here.\" \\nThe direwolf trotted to him. Jon heard Samwell Tarly\\'s sharp intake of breath. \\n\"Gods be good,\" Dywen muttered. \"That\\'s a hand.\" \\nEDDARD \\nThe grey light of dawn was streaming through his window when the thunder of hoofbeats awoke Eddard \\nStark from his brief, exhausted sleep. He lifted his head from the table to look down into the yard. \\nBelow, men in mail and leather and crimson cloaks were making the morning ring to the sound of swords, \\nand riding down mock warriors stuffed with straw. Ned watched Sandor Clegane gallop across the \\nhard-packed ground to drive an iron-tipped lance through a dummy\\'s head. Canvas ripped and straw \\nexploded as Lannister guardsmen joked and cursed. \\nIs this brave show for my benefit? he wondered. If so, Cersei was a greater fool than he\\'d imagined. \\nDamn her, he thought, why is the woman not fled? I have given her chance after chance . . . \\nThe morning was overcast and grim. Ned broke his fast with his daughters and Septa Mordane. Sansa, \\nstill disconsolate, stared sullenly at her food and refused to eat, but Arya wolfed down everything that \\nwas set in front of her. \"Syrio says we have time for one last lesson before we take ship this evening,\" she \\nsaid. \"Can 1, Father? All my things are packed.\" \\n\"A short lesson, and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and change. I want you ready to \\nleave by midday, is that understood?\" \\n\"By midday,\" Arya said. \\nSansa looked up from her food. \"If she can have a dancing lesson, why won\\'t you let me say farewell to \\nPrince Joffrey?\" \\n\"I would gladly go with her, Lord Eddard,\" Septa Mordane offered. \"There would be no question of her \\nmissing the ship.\" \\n\"It would not be wise for you to go to Joffrey right now, Sansa. I\\'m sorry.\" \\nSansa\\'s eyes filled with tears. \"But why?\" \\n\"Sansa, your lord father knows best,\" Septa Mordane said. \"You are not to question his decisions.\" \\n\"It\\'s notfair!\" Sansa pushed back from her table, knocked over her chair, and ran weeping from the \\nsolar. \\nSepta Mordane rose, but Ned gestured her back to her seat. \"Let her go, Septa. I will try to make her \\nunderstand when we are all safely back in Winterfell.\" The septa bowed her head and sat down to finish \\nPage 350\\n\\nher breakfast. \\nIt was an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in his solar. His shoulders \\nslumped, as if the weight of the great maester\\'s chain around his neck had become too great to bear. \"My \\nlord,\" he said, \"King Robert is gone. The gods give him rest.\" \\n\"No,\" Ned answered. \"He hated rest. The gods give him love and laughter, and the joy of righteous \\nbattle.\" It was strange how empty he felt. He had been expecting the visit, and yet with those words, \\nsomething died within him. He would have given all his titles for the freedom to weep . . . but he was \\nRobert\\'s Hand, and the hour he dreaded had come. \"Be so good as to summon the members of the \\ncouncil here to my solar,\" he told Pycelle. The Tower of the Hand was as secure as he and Tomard \\ncould make it; he could not say the same for the council chambers. \\n\"My lord?\" Pycelle blinked. \"Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till the morrow, when our grief is \\nnot so fresh.\" \\nNed was quiet but firm. \"I fear we must convene at once.\" \\nPycelle bowed. \"As the Hand commands.\" He called his servants and sent them running, then gratefully \\naccepted Ned\\'s offer of a chair and a cup of sweet beer. \\nSer Barristan Selmy was the first to answer the summons, immaculate in white cloak and enameled \\nscales. \"My lords,\" he said, \"my place is beside the young king now. Pray give me leave to attend him.\" \\n\"Your place is here, Ser Barristan,\" Ned told him. \\nLittlefinger came next, still garbed in the blue velvets and silver mockingbird cape he had worn the night \\nprevious, his boots dusty from riding. \"My lords,\" he said, smiling at nothing in particular before he \\nturned to Ned. \"That little task you set me is accomplished, Lord Eddard.\" \\nVarys entered in a wash of lavender, pink from his bath, his plump face scrubbed and freshly powdered, \\nhis soft slippers all but soundless. \"The little birds sing a grievous song today,\" he said as he seated \\nhimself. \"The realm weeps. Shall we begin?\" \\n\"When Lord Renly arrives,\" Ned said. \\nVarys gave him a sorrowful look. \"I fear Lord Renly has left the city.\" \\n\"Left the city?\" Ned had counted on Renly\\'s support. \\n\"He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn, accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and \\nsome fifty retainers,\" Varys told them. \"When last seen, they were galloping south in some haste, no \\ndoubt bound for Storm\\'s End or Highgarden.\" \\nSo much for Renly and his hundred swords. Ned did not like the smell of that, but there was nothing to \\nbe done for it. He drew out Robert\\'s last letter. \"The king called me to his side last night and commanded \\nme to record his final words. Lord Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the \\nletter, to be opened by the council after his death. Ser Barristan, if you would be so kind?\" \\nPage 351\\n\\nThe Lord Commander of the Kingsguard examined the paper. \"King Robert\\'s seal, and unbroken.\" He \\nopened the letter and read. \"Lord Eddard Stark is herein named Protector of the Realm, to rule as regent \\nuntil the heir comes of age.\" \\nAnd as it happens, he is of age, Ned reflected, but he did not give voice to the thought. He trusted \\nneither Pycelle nor Varys, and Ser Barristan was honor-bound to protect and defend the boy he thought \\nhis new king. The old knight would not abandon Joffrey easily. The need for deceit was a bitter taste in \\nhis mouth, but Ned knew he must tread softly here, must keep his counsel and play the game until he was \\nfirmly established as regent. There would be time enough to deal with the succession when Arya and \\nSansa were safely back in Winterfell, and Lord Stannis had returned to King\\'s Landing with all his \\npower. \\n\"I would ask this council to confirm me as Lord Protector, as Robert wished,\" Ned said, watching their \\nfaces, wondering what thoughts hid behind Pycelle\\'s half-closed eyes, Littlefinger\\'s lazy half-smile, and \\nthe nervous flutter of Varys\\'s fingers. \\nThe door opened. Fat Tom stepped into the solar. \"Pardon, my lords, the king\\'s steward insists . . .\" \\nThe royal steward entered and bowed. \"Esteemed lords, the king \\ndemands the immediate presence of his small council in the throne room.\" \\nNed had expected Cersei to strike quickly; the summons came as no surprise. \"The king is dead,\" he \\nsaid, \"but we shall go with you nonetheless. Tom, assemble an escort, if you would.\" \\nLittlefinger gave Ned his arm to help him down the steps. Varys, Pycelle, and Ser Barristan followed \\nclose behind. A double column of men-at-arms in chainmail and steel helms was waiting outside the \\ntower, eight strong. Grey cloaks snapped in the wind as the guardsmen marched them across the yard. \\nThere was no Lannister crimson to be seen, but Ned was reassured by the number of gold cloaks visible \\non the ramparts and at the gates. \\nJanos Slynt met them at the door to the throne room, armored in ornate black-and-gold plate, with a \\nhigh-crested helm under one arm. The Commander bowed stiffly. His men pushed open the great oaken \\ndoors, twenty feet tall and banded with bronze. \\nThe royal steward led them in. \"All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the \\nFirst of his Name, King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms \\nand Protector of the Realm,\" he sang out. \\nIt was a long walk to the far end of the hall, where Joffrey waited atop the Iron Throne. Supported by \\nLittlefinger, Ned Stark slowly limped and hopped toward the boy who called himself king. The others \\nfollowed. The first time he had come this way, he had been on horseback, sword in hand, and the \\nTargaryen dragons had watched from the walls as he forced Jaime Lannister down from the throne. He \\nwondered if Joffrey would step down quite so easily. \\nFive knights of the Kingsguard-all but Ser Jaime and Ser Barristan-were arrayed in a crescent around \\nthe base of the throne. They were in full armor, enameled steel from helm to heel, long pale cloaks over \\ntheir shoulders, shining white shields strapped to their left arms. Cersei Lannister and her two younger \\nPage 352\\n\\nchildren stood behind Ser Boros and Ser Meryn. The queen wore a gown of sea-green silk, trimmed \\nwith Myrish lace as pale as foam. On her finger was a golden ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon\\'s \\negg, on her head a matching tiara. \\nAbove them, Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gold doublet and a red satin \\ncape. Sandor Clegane was stationed at the foot of the throne\\'s steep narrow stair. He wore mail and \\nsoot-grey plate and his snarling dog\\'s-head helm. \\nBehind the throne, twenty Lannister guardsmen waited with longswords hanging from their belts. \\nCrimson cloaks draped their shoulders and steel lions crested their helms. But Littlefinger had kept his \\npromise; all along the walls, in front of Robert\\'s tapestries with their scenes of hunt and battle, the \\ngold-cloaked ranks of the City Watch stood stiffly to attention, each man\\'s hand clasped around the haft \\nof an eight-foot-long spear tipped in black iron. They outnumbered the Lannisters five to one. \\nNed\\'s leg was a blaze of pain by the time he stopped. He kept a hand on Littlefinger\\'s shoulder to help \\nsupport his weight. \\nJoffrey stood. His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread; fifty roaring lions to one side, fifty \\nprancing stags to the other. \"I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my \\ncoronation,\" the boy proclaimed. \"I wish to be crowned within the fortnight. Today I shall accept oaths of \\nfealty from my loyal councillors.\" \\nNed produced Robert\\'s letter. \"Lord Varys, be so kind as to show this to my lady of Lannister.\" \\nThe eunuch carried the letter to Cersei. The queen glanced at the words. \"Protector of the Realm,\" she \\nread. \"Is this meant to be your shield, my lord? A piece of paper?\" She ripped the letter in half, ripped \\nthe halves in quarters, and let the pieces flutter to the floor. \\n\"Those were the king\\'s words,\" Ser Barristan said, shocked. \\n\"We have a new king now,\" Cersei Lannister replied. \"Lord Eddard, when last we spoke, you gave me \\nsome counsel. Allow me to return the courtesy. Bend the knee, my lord. Bend the knee and swear fealty \\nto my son, and we shall allow you to step down as Hand and live out your days in the grey waste you call \\nhome.\" \\n\"Would that I could,\" Ned said grimly. If she was so determined to force the issue here and now, she left \\nhim no choice. \"Your son has no claim to the throne he sits. Lord Stannis is Robert\\'s true heir.\" \\n\"Liar!\" Joffrey screamed, his face reddening. \\n\"Mother, what does he mean?\" Princess Myrcella asked the queen plaintively. \"Isn\\'t Joff the king now?\" \\n\"You condemn yourself with your own mouth, Lord Stark,\" said Cersei Lannister. \"Ser Barristan, seize \\nthis traitor.\" \\nThe Lord Commander of the Kingsguard hesitated. In the blink of an eye he was surrounded by Stark \\nguardsmen, bare steel in their mailed fists. \\nPage 353\\n\\n\"And now the treason moves from words to deeds,\" Cersei said. \"Do you think Ser Barristan stands \\nalone, my lord?\" With an ominous rasp of metal on metal, the Hound drew his longsword. The knights of \\nthe Kingsguard and twenty Lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks moved to support him. \\n\"Kill him!\" the boy king screamed down from the Iron Throne. \"Kill all of them, I command it!\" \\n\"You leave me no choice,\" Ned told Cersei Lannister. He called out to Janos Slynt. \"Commander, take \\nthe queen and her children into custody. Do them no harm, but escort them back to the royal apartments \\nand keep them there, under guard.\" \\n\"Men of the Watch!\" Janos Slynt shouted, donning his helm. A hundred gold cloaks leveled their spears \\nand closed. \\n\"I want no bloodshed,\" Ned told the queen. \"Tell your men to lay down their swords, and no one need-\" \\nWith a single sharp thrust, the nearest gold cloak drove his spear into Tomard\\'s back. Fat Tom\\'s blade \\ndropped from nerveless fingers as the wet red point burst out through his ribs, piercing leather and mail. \\nHe was dead before his sword hit the floor. \\nNed\\'s shout came far too late. Janos Slynt himself slashed open Varly\\'s throat. Cayn whirled, steel \\nflashing, drove back the nearest spearman with a flurry of blows; for an instant it looked as though he \\nmight cut his way free. Then the Hound was on him. Sandor Clegane\\'s first cut took off Cayn\\'s sword \\nhand at the wrist; his second drove him to his knees and opened him from shoulder to breastbone. \\nAs his men died around him, Littlefinger slid Ned\\'s dagger from its sheath and shoved it up under his \\nchin. His smile was apologetic. \"I did warn you not to trust me, you know.\" \\nARYA \\n\"High,\" Syrio Forel called out, slashing at her head. The stick swords clacked as Arya parried. \\n\"Left,\" he shouted, and his blade came whistling. Hers darted to meet it. The clack made him click his \\nteeth together. \\n\"Right,\" he said, and \"Low,\" and \"Left,\" and \"Left\" again, faster and faster, moving forward. Arya \\nretreated before him, checking each blow. \\n\"Lunge,\" he warned, and when he thrust she sidestepped, swept his blade away, and slashed at his \\nshoulder. She almost touched him, almost, so close it made her grin. A strand of hair dangled in her eyes, \\nlimp with sweat. She pushed it away with the back of her hand. \\n\"Left,\" Syrio sang out. \"Low.\" His sword was a blur, and the Small Hall echoed to the clack clack clack. \\n\"Left. Left. High. Left. Right. Left. Low. Left!\" \\nThe wooden blade caught her high in the breast, a sudden stinging blow that hurt all the more because it \\ncame from the wrong side. \"Owl \" she cried out. She would have a fresh bruise there by the time she \\nwent to sleep, somewhere out at sea. A bruise is a lesson, she told herself, and each lesson makes us \\nPage 354\\n\\nbetter. \\nSyrio stepped back. \"You are dead now.\" \\nArya made a face. \"You cheated,\" she said hotly. \"You said left and you went right.\" \\n\"Just so. And now you are a dead girl.\" \\n\"But you lied!\" \\n\"My words lied. My eyes and my arm shouted out the truth, but you were not seeing.\" \\n\"I was so,\" Arya said. \"I watched you every second!\" \\n\"Watching is not seeing, dead girl. The water dancer sees. Come, put down the sword, it is time for \\nlistening now.\" \\nShe followed him over to the wall, where he settled onto a bench. \"Syrio Forel was first sword to the \\nSealord of Braavos, and are you knowing how that came to pass?\" \\n\"You were the finest swordsman in the city.\" \\n\"Just so, but why? Other men were stronger, faster, younger, why was Syrio Forel the best? I will tell \\nyou now.\" He touched the tip of his little finger lightly to his eyelid. \"The seeing, the true seeing, that is the \\nheart of it. \\n\"Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands strange and wonderful, and when \\nthey return their captains fetch queer animals to the Sealord\\'s menagerie. Such animals as you have never \\nseen, striped horses, great spotted things with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, \\nstinging manticores, tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with scythes for claws. \\nSyrio Forel has seen these things. \\n\"On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord sent for me. Many \\nbravos had come to him, and as many had been sent away, none could say why. When I came into his \\npresence, he was seated, and in his lap was a fat yellow cat. He told me that one of his captains had \\nbrought the beast to him, from an island beyond the sunrise. \\'Have you ever seen her likeT he asked of \\nme. \\n\"And to him I said, \\'Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like him,\\' and the Sealord \\nlaughed, and that day I was named the first sword.\" \\nArya screwed up her face. \"I don\\'t understand.\" \\nSyrio clicked his teeth together. \"The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The others expected a fabulous \\nbeast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat \\nfrom indolence, for the Sealord fed it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had \\nbeen chewed away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said \\'her,\\' and that is what \\nthe others saw. Are you hearing?\" \\nPage 355\\n\\nArya thought about it. \"You saw what was there.\" \\n\"Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the \\neyes see true. Look with your \\neyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then \\ncomes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.\" \\n\"Just so,\" said Arya, grinning. \\nSyrio Forel allowed himself a smile. \"I am thinking that when we are reaching this Winterfell of yours, it \\nwill be time to put this needle in your hand.\" \\n\"Yes!\" Arya said eagerly. \"Wait till I show Jon-\" \\nBehind her the great wooden doors of the Small Hall flew open with a resounding crash. Arya whirled. \\nA knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five Lannister guardsmen arrayed \\nbehind him. He was in full armor, but his visor was up. Arya remembered his droopy eyes and \\nrustcolored whiskers from when he had come to Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant. The red \\ncloaks wore mail shirts over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests. \"Arya Stark,\" the knight said, \\n\"come with us, child.\" \\nArya chewed her lip uncertainly. \"What do you want?\" \\n\"Your father wants to see you.\" \\nArya took a step forward, but Syrio Forel held her by the arm. \"And why is it that Lord Eddard is \\nsending Lannister men in the place of his own? I am wondering.\" \\n\"Mind your place, dancing master,\" Ser Meryn said. \"This is no concern of yours.\" \\n\"My father wouldn\\'t send you,\" Arya said. She snatched up her stick sword. The Lannisters laughed. \\n\"Put down the stick, girl,\" Ser Meryn told her. \"I am a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, the White \\nSwords.\" \\n\"So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king,\" Arya said. \"I don\\'t have to go with you if I don\\'t \\nwant.\" \\nSer Meryn Trant ran out of patience. \"Take her,\" he said to his men. He lowered the visor of his helm. \\nThree of them started forward, chainmail clinking softly with each step. Arya was suddenly afraid. Fear \\ncuts deeper than swords, she told herself, to slow the racing of her heart. \\nSyrio Forel stepped between them, tapping his wooden sword lightly against his boot. \"You will be \\nstopping there. Are you men or dogs that you would threaten a child?\" \\n\"Out of the way, old man,\" one of the red cloaks said. \\nPage 356\\n\\nSyrio\\'s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm. \"I am Syrio Forel, and you will now be \\nspeaking to me with more respect.\" \\n\"Bald bastard.\" The man yanked free his longsword. The stick \\nmoved again, blindingly fast. Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone floor. \\n\"My hand,\" the guardsman yelped, cradling his broken fingers. \\n\"You are quick, for a dancing master,\" said Ser Meryn. \\n\"You are slow, for a knight,\" Syrio replied. \\n\"Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,\" the knight in the white armor commanded. \\nFour Lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords. The fifth, with the broken fingers, spat and pulled \\nfree a dagger with his left hand. \\nSyrio Forel clicked his teeth together, sliding into his water dancer\\'s stance, presenting only his side to \\nthe foe. \"Arya child,\" he called out, never looking, never taking his eyes off the Lannisters, \"we are done \\nwith dancing for the day. Best you are going now. Run to your father.\" \\nArya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said. \"Swift as a deer, \" she \\nwhispered. \\n\"Just so,\" said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed. \\nArya retreated, her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand. Watching him now, she realized that \\nSyrio had only been toying with her when they dueled. The red cloaks came at him from three sides with \\nsteel in their hands. They had chainmail over their chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their \\npants, but only leather on their legs. Their hands were bare, and the caps they wore had noseguards, but \\nno visor over the eyes. \\nSyrio did not wait for them to reach him, but spun to his left. Arya had never seen a man move as fast. \\nHe checked one sword with his stick and whirled away from a second. Off balance, the second man \\nlurched into the first. Syrio put a boot to his back and the red cloaks went down together. The third \\nguard came leaping over them, slashing at the water dancer\\'s head. Syrio ducked under his blade and \\nthrust upward. The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole where his left eye \\nhad been. \\nThe fallen men were getting up. Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the steel cap off the other\\'s \\nhead. The dagger man stabbed at him. Syrio caught the thrust in the helmet and shattered the man\\'s \\nkneecap with his stick. The last red cloak shouted a curse and charged, hacking down with both hands \\non his sword. Syrio rolled right, and the butcher\\'s cut caught the helmetless man between neck and \\nshoulder as he struggled to his knees. The longsword crunched through mail and leather and flesh. The \\nman on his knees shrieked. Before his killer could wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the apple of \\nhis throat. The guardsman gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at his neck, his face \\nblackening. \\nPage 357\\n\\nFive men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door that opened on the \\nkitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. \"Bloody oafs,\" he swore, drawing his longsword from its \\nscabbard. \\nSyrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. \"Arya child,\" he called out, never looking \\nat her, \"be gone now.\" \\nLook with your eyes, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head to foot, legs, throat, and \\nhands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white helm, and in his hand cruel steel. Against that: \\nSyrio, in a leather vest, with a wooden sword in his hand. \"Syrio, run,\" she screamed. \\n\"The first sword of Braavos does not run,\" he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at him. Syrio danced away \\nfrom his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartbeat, he had bounced blows off the knight\\'s temple, elbow, and \\nthroat, the wood ringing against the metal of helm, gauntlet, and gorget. Arya stood frozen. Ser Meryn \\nadvanced; Syrio backed away. He checked the next blow, spun away from the second, deflected the \\nthird. \\nThe fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through the lead core. \\nSobbing, Arya spun and ran. \\nShe plunged through the kitchens and buttery, blind with panic, weaving between cooks and potboys. A \\nbaker\\'s helper stepped in front of her, holding a wooden tray. Arya bowled her over, scattering fragrant \\nloaves of fresh-baked bread on the floor. She heard shouting behind her as she spun around a portly \\nbutcher who stood gaping at her with a cleaver in his hands. His arms were red to the elbow. \\nAll that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head. Swift as a deer. Quiet as a shadow. \\nFear cuts deeper than swords. Quick as a snake. Calm as still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. \\nStrong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. Fear cuts deeper than swords. The man who fears losing has \\nalready lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Fear cuts deeper than \\nswords. The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard when she \\nreached the turret stair. For an instant she froze. Up or down? Up would take her to the covered bridge \\nthat spanned the small court to the Tower of the Hand, but that would be the way they\\'d expect her to \\ngo, for certain. Never do what they expect, Syrio once said. Arya went down, around and around, \\nleaping over the narrow stone steps two and three at a time. She emerged in a cavernous vaulted cellar, \\nsurrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall. The only light came through narrow slanting windows \\nhigh in the wall. \\nThe cellar was a dead end. There was no way out but the way she \\nhad come in. She dare not go back up those steps, but she couldn\\'t stay here, either. She had to find her \\nfather and tell him what had happened. Her father would protect her. \\nArya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb, leaping from cask to cask until she \\ncould reach the window. Grasping the stone with both hands, she pulled herself up. The wall was three \\nfeet thick, the window a tunnel slanting up and out. Arya wriggled toward daylight. When her head \\nreached ground level, she peered across the bailey to the Tower of the Hand. \\nPage 358\\n\\nThe stout wooden door hung splintered and broken, as if by axes. A dead man sprawled facedown on \\nthe steps, his cloak tangled beneath him, the back of his mailed shirt soaked red. The corpse\\'s cloak was \\ngrey wool trimmed with white satin, she saw with sudden terror. She could not tell who he was. \\n\"No, \" she whispered. What was happening? Where was her father? Why had the red cloaks come for \\nher? She remembered what the man with the yellow beard had said, the day she had found the monsters. \\nIf one Hand can die, why not a second? Arya felt tears in her eyes. She held her breath to listen. She \\nheard the sounds of fighting, shouts, screams, the clang of steel on steel, coming through the windows of \\nthe Tower of the Hand. \\nShe could not go back. Her father . . . \\nArya closed her eyes. For a moment she was too frightened to move. They had killed Jory and Wyl and \\nHeward, and that guardsman on the step, whoever he had been. They could kill her father too, and her if \\nthey caught her. \"Fear cuts deeper than swords, \" she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a \\nwater dancer, Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and anyhow \\nshe was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid. \\nShe squirmed out into the yard, glancing around warily as she climbed to her feet. The castle seemed \\ndeserted. The Red Keep was never deserted. All the people must be hiding inside, their doors barred. \\nArya glanced up longingly at her bedchamber, then moved away from the Tower of the Hand, keeping \\nclose to the wall as she slid from shadow to shadow. She pretended she was chasing cats . . . except she \\nwas the cat now, and if they caught her, they would kill her. \\nMoving between buildings and over walls, keeping stone to her back wherever possible so no one could \\nsurprise her, Arya reached the stables almost without incident. A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate ran \\npast as she was edging across the inner bailey, but without knowing whose side they were on, she \\nhunched down low in the shadows and let them pass. \\nHullen, who had been master of horse at Winterfell as long as Arya could remember, was slumped on \\nthe ground by the stable door. He had been stabbed so many times it looked as if his tunic was patterned \\nwith scarlet flowers. Arya was certain he was dead, but when she crept closer, his eyes opened. \"Arya \\nUnderfoot,\" he whispered. \"You must . . . warn your . . . your lord father . . .\" Frothy red spittle bubbled \\nfrom his mouth. The master of horse closed his eyes again and said no more. \\nInside were more bodies; a groom she had played with, and three of her father\\'s household guard. A \\nwagon, laden with crates and chests, stood abandoned near the door of the stable. The dead men must \\nhave been loading it for the trip to the docks when they were attacked. Arya snuck closer. One of the \\ncorpses was Desmond, who\\'d shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father. He lay on his \\nback, staring blindly at the ceiling as flies crawled across his eyes. Close to him was a dead man in the \\nred cloak and lion-crest helm of the Lannisters. Only one, though. Every northerner is worth ten of these \\nsouthron swords, Desmond had told her. \"You liar!\" she said, kicking his body in a sudden fury. \\nThe animals were restless in their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent of blood. Arya\\'s only plan \\nwas to saddle a horse and flee, away from the castle and the city. All she had to do was stay on the \\nkingsroad and it would take her back to Winterfell. She took a bridle and harness off the wall. \\nAs she crossed in back of the wagon, a fallen chest caught her eye. It must have been knocked down in \\nPage 359\\n\\nthe fight or dropped as it was being loaded. The wood had split, the lid opening to spill the chest\\'s \\ncontents across the ground. Arya recognized silks and satins and velvets she never wore. She might need \\nwarm clothes on the kingsroad, though . . . and besides . . . \\nArya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes. She found a heavy woolen cloak, a velvet skirt and a \\nsilk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress her mother had embroidered for her, a silver baby bracelet she \\nmight sell. Shoving the broken lid out of the way, she groped inside the chest for Needle. She had hidden \\nit way down at the bottom, under everything, but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the chest \\nwas dropped. For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword and stolen it. Then her \\nfingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown. \\n\"There she is,\" a voice hissed close behind her. \\nStartled, Arya whirled. A stableboy stood behind her, a smirk on his face, his filthy white undertunic \\npeeking out from beneath a soiled \\njerkin. His boots were covered with manure, and he had a pitchfork in one hand. \"Who are you?\" she \\nasked. \\n\"She don\\'t know me,\" he said, \"but I knows her, oh, yes. The wolf girl.\" \\n\"Help me saddle a horse,\" Arya pleaded, reaching back into the chest, groping for Needle. \"My father\\'s \\nthe Hand of the King, he\\'ll reward you.\" \\n\"Father\\'s dead,\" the boy said. He shuffled toward her. \"It\\'s the queen who\\'ll be rewarding me. Come \\nhere, girl.\" \\n\"Stay away!\" Her fingers closed around Needle\\'s hilt. \\n\"I says, come.\" He grabbed her arm, hard. \\nEverything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat. In that instant of sudden terror, the \\nonly lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon Snow had given her, the very first. \\nShe stuck him with the pointy end, driving the blade upward with a wild, hysterical strength. \\nNeedle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out between his shoulder \\nblades. The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise, something between a gasp and a sigh. His \\nhands closed around the blade. \"Oh, gods,\" he moaned, as his undertunic began to redden. \"Take it out.\" \\nWhen she took it out, he died. \\nThe horses were screaming. Arya stood over the body, still and frightened in the face of death. Blood \\nhad gushed from the boy\\'s mouth as he collapsed, and more was seeping from the slit in his belly, pooling \\nbeneath his body. His palms were cut where he\\'d grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly, \\nNeedle red in her hand. She had to get away, someplace far from here, someplace safe away from the \\nstableboy\\'s accusing eyes. \\nShe snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare, but as she lifted the saddle to the \\nPage 360\\n\\nhorse\\'s back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the castle gates would be closed. Even the \\npostern doors would likely be guarded. Maybe the guards wouldn\\'t recognize her. If they thought she \\nwas a boy, perhaps they\\'d let her . . . no, they\\'d have orders not to let anyone out, it wouldn\\'t matter \\nwhether they knew her or not. \\nBut there was another way out of the castle . . . \\nThe saddle slipped from Arya\\'s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a puff of dust. Could she find \\nthe room with the monsters again? She wasn\\'t certain, yet she knew she had to try. \\nShe found the clothing she\\'d gathered and slipped into the cloak, concealing Needle beneath its folds. \\nThe rest of her things she tied in a \\nroll. With the bundle under her arm, she crept to the far end of the stable. Unlatching the back door, she \\npeeked out anxiously. She could hear the distant sound of swordplay, and the shivery wail of a man \\nscreaming in pain across the bailey. She would need to go down the serpentine steps, past the small \\nkitchen and the pig yard, that was how she\\'d gone last time, chasing the black tomcat . . . only that would \\ntake her right past the barracks of the gold cloaks. She couldn\\'t go that way. Arya tried to think of \\nanother way. If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the river wall and \\nthrough the little godswood . . . but first she\\'d have to cross the yard, in the plain view of the guards on \\nthe walls. \\nShe had never seen so many men on the walls. Gold cloaks, most of them, armed with spears. Some of \\nthem knew her by sight. What would they do if they saw her running across the yard? She\\'d look so \\nsmall from up there, would they be able to tell who she was? Would they care? \\nShe had to leave now, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was too frightened to move. \\nCalm as still water, a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled she almost dropped her \\nbundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in the stable but her, and the horses, and the \\ndead men. \\nQuiet as a shadow, she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio\\'s? She could not tell, yet somehow it \\ncalmed her fears. \\nShe stepped out of the stable. \\nIt was the scariest thing she\\'d ever done. She wanted to run and hide, but she made herself walk across \\nthe yard, slowly, putting one foot in front of the other as if she had all the time in the world and no reason \\nto be afraid of anyone. She thought she could feel their eyes, like bugs crawling on her skin under her \\nclothes. Arya never looked up. If she saw them watching, all her courage would desert her, she knew, \\nand she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby, and then they would have her. She \\nkept her gaze on the ground. By the time she reached the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the \\nyard, Arya was cold with sweat, but no one had raised the hue and cry. \\nThe sept was open and empty. Inside, half a hundred prayer candles burned in a fragrant silence. Arya \\nfigured the gods would never miss two. She stuffed them up her sleeves, and left by a back window. \\nSneaking back to the alley where she had cornered the one-eared tom was easy, but after that she got \\nlost. She crawled in and out of windows, hopped over walls, and felt her way through dark cellars, quiet \\nPage 361\\n\\nas a shadow. Once she heard a woman weeping. It took her more than an hour to find the low narrow \\nwindow that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters waited. \\nShe tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle. That was chancy; the fire she\\'d \\nremembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard voices as she was blowing on the coals. \\nCupping her fingers around the flickering candle, she went out the window as they were coming in the \\ndoor, without ever getting a glimpse of who it was. \\nThis time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. Arya held the candle over \\nher head. With each step she took, the shadows moved against the walls, as if they were turning to watch \\nher pass. \"Dragons, \" she whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade \\nseemed very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her hand. \\nThe long windowless hall beyond the door was as black as she remembered. She held Needle in her left \\nhand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot wax ran down across her knuckles. The entrance \\nto the well had been to the left, so Arya went right. Part of her wanted to run, but she was afraid of \\nsnuffing out her candle. She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing eyes on \\nthe edge of the light, but rats did not scare her. Other things did. It would be so easy to hide here, as she \\nhad hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard. She could almost see the stableboy \\nstanding against the wall, his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in \\nhis palms where Needle had cut him. He might be waiting to grab her as she passed. He would see her \\ncandle coming a long way off. Maybe she would be better off without the light . . . \\nFear cuts deeper than swords, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly Arya remembered the \\ncrypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, she told herself. She\\'d been just a little girl the \\nfirst time she saw them. Her brother Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who\\'d \\nbeen no bigger than Rickon was now. They\\'d only had one candle between them, and Bran\\'s eyes had \\ngotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, with their wolves at their \\nfeet and their iron swords across their laps. \\nRobb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon and Lyanna, to show them \\ntheir own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had \\ntold her there were spiders down here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. \"There \\nare worse things than spiders \\nand rats,\" he whispered. \"This is where the dead walk.\" That was when they heard the sound, low and \\ndeep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched at Arya\\'s hand. \\nWhen the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for blood, Sansa ran shrieking for \\nthe stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb\\'s leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the \\nspirit a punch. It was only Jon, covered with flour. \"You stupid,\" she told him, \"you scared the baby,\" but \\nJon and Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too. \\nThe memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. The stableboy \\nwas dead, she\\'d killed him, and if he jumped out at her she\\'d kill him again. She was going home. \\nEverything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell\\'s grey granite walls. \\nPage 362\\n\\nHer footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper into the darkness. \\nSANSA \\nThey came for Sansa on the third day. \\nShe chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly embroidered around the collar and \\nsleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of \\nservants. Jeyne Poole had been confined with her, but Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from all her \\ncrying, and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father. \\n\"I\\'m certain your father is well,\" Sansa told her when she had finally gotten the dress buttoned right. \"I\\'ll \\nask the queen to let you see him.\" She thought that kindness might lift Jeyne\\'s spirits, but the other girl just \\nlooked at her with red, swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a child. \\nSansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor\\'s Holdfast, with her door \\nclosed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the killing began. She had grown up to the sound \\nof steel in the yard, and scarcely a day of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on \\nsword, yet somehow knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it \\nas she had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, angry curses, \\nshouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men. In the songs, the knights never screamed nor \\nbegged for mercy. \\nSo she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was happening, calling for her father, \\nfor Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant prince. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave \\nno answer. The only time the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, \\nbruised and shaking. \"They\\'re killing everyone, \" the steward\\'s daughter had shrieked at her. She went on \\nand on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she said. There were bodies on the \\nstair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as she \\nstruggled to comfort her friend. They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other\\'s arms like \\nsisters. \\nThe second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined was at the top of the \\nhighest tower of Maegor\\'s Holdfast. From its window, she could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the \\ngatehouse was down, and the drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the \\nkeep-within-a-keep from the larger castle that surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls with \\nspears and crossbows to hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the grave had settled over the \\nRed Keep. The only sounds were Jeyne Poole\\'s endless whimpers and sobs. \\nThey were fed-hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their fast, roast chicken and \\ngreens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley stew-but the servants who brought the meals \\nwould not answer Sansa\\'s questions. That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of \\nthe Hand, and some of Jeyne\\'s things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and when \\nshe tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The guards outside the door still \\nrefused to let them leave the room. \\nPage 363\\n\\n\"Please, I need to speak to the queen again,\" Sansa told them, as she told everyone she saw that day. \\n\"She\\'ll want to talk to me, I know she will. Tell her I want to see her, please. If not the queen, then Prince \\nJoffrey, if you\\'d be so kind. We\\'re to marry when we\\'re older.\" \\nAt sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring. Its voice was deep and sonorous, and the long \\nslow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing went on and on, and after a while they heard \\nother bells answering from the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya\\'s Hill. The sound rumbled across the city \\nlike thunder, warning of the storm to come. \\n\"What is it?\" Jeyne asked, covering her ears. \"Why are they ringing the bells?\" \\n\"The king is dead.\" Sansa could not say how she knew it, yet she \\ndid. The slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy stormed the \\ncastle and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting they had heard? \\nShe went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey the king now? Or had they \\nkilled him too? She was afraid for him, and for her father. If only they would tell her what was happening \\n. . . \\nThat night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with herself seated beside him in a gown of woven \\ngold. She had a crown on her head, and everyone she had ever known came before her, to bend the \\nknee and say their courtesies. \\nThe next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the Kingsguard came to escort her \\nto the queen. \\nSer Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose was flat, his cheeks \\nbaggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white velvet, and his snowy cloak was \\nfastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies. \"You \\nlook very handsome and splendid this morning, Ser Boros,\" Sansa told him. A lady remembered her \\ncourtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what. \\n\"And you, my lady,\" Ser Boros said in a flat voice. \"Her Grace awaits. Come with me.\" \\nThere were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. \\nSansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a good morning as she passed. It was the first \\ntime she had been allowed outside the chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings \\npast. \"To keep you safe, my sweet one,\" Queen Cersei had told her. \"Joffrey would never forgive me if \\nanything happened to his precious.\" \\nSansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, but instead he led her out \\nof Maegor\\'s Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some workmen were lowering a man on ropes into \\nthe depths of the dry moat. When Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes \\nbelow. She averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be someone \\nshe knew. \\nThey found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long table littered with \\npapers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen. \\nPage 364\\n\\nShe stared in awe at the carved wooden screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door. \\n\"Your Grace,\" Ser Boros said when they were ushered inside by \\nanother of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face, \"I\\'ve brought the girl.\" \\nSansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three of the king\\'s councillors \\nwere. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen\\'s left hand, Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, \\nwhile Lord Varys hovered over them, smelling flowery. All of them were clad in black, she realized with \\na feeling of dread. Mourning clothes . . . \\nThe queen wore a high-collared black silk gown, with a hundred dark red rubies sewn into her bodice, \\ncovering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping \\nblood. Cersei smiled to see her, and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever \\nseen. \"Sansa, my sweet child,\" she said, \"I know you\\'ve been asking for me. I\\'m sorry that I could not \\nsend for you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had a moment. I trust my people \\nhave been taking good care of you?\" \\n\"Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so much for asking,\" Sansa \\nsaid politely. \"Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us what\\'s happened \\n\"Us?\" Cersei seemed puzzled. \\n\"We put the steward\\'s girl in with her,\" Ser Boros said. \"We did not know what else to do with her.\" \\nThe queen frowned. \"Next time, you will ask,\" she said, her voice sharp. \"The gods only know what sort \\nof tales she\\'s been filling Sansa\\'s head with.\" \\n\"Jeyne\\'s scared,\" Sansa said. \"She won\\'t stop crying. I promised her I\\'d ask if she could see her father.\" \\nOld Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes. \\n\"Her father is well, isn\\'t he?\" Sansa said anxiously. She knew there had been fighting, but surely no one \\nwould harm a steward. Vayon Poole did not even wear a sword. \\nQueen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn. \"I won\\'t have Sansa fretting needlessly. What \\nshall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?\" \\nLord Petyr leaned forward. \"I\\'ll find a place for her.\" \\n\"Not in the city,\" said the queen. \\n\"Do you take me for a fool?\" \\nThe queen ignored that. \"Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr\\'s apartments and instruct his people to \\nkeep her there until he comes for her. Tell her that Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father, that \\nought to calm her down. I want her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber.\" \\nPage 365\\n\\n\"As you command, Your Grace,\" Ser Boros said. He bowed deeply, spun on his heel, and took his \\nleave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him. \\nSansa was confused. \"I don\\'t understand,\" she said. \"Where is Jeyne\\'s father? Why can\\'t Ser Boros take \\nher to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?\" She had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle \\nas the queen and as strong as her mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again. \\nFor a second she thought she might cry. \"Where are you sending her? She hasn\\'t done anything wrong, \\nshe\\'s a good girl.\" \\n\"She\\'s upset you,\" the queen said gently. \"We can\\'t be having that. Not another word, now. Lord Baelish \\nwill see that Jeyne\\'s well taken care of, I promise you.\" She patted the chair beside her. \"Sit down, \\nSansa. I want to talk to you.\" \\nSansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not make her feel any less \\nanxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the \\npapers in front of him, but she could feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the small man \\nlooked at her made Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on. Goose bumps pimpled her skin. \\n\"Sweet Sansa,\" Queen Cersei said, laying a soft hand on her wrist. \"Such a beautiful child. I do hope you \\nknow how much Joffrey and I love you.\" \\n\"You do?\" Sansa said, breathless. Littlefinger was forgotten. Her prince loved her. Nothing else \\nmattered. \\nThe queen smiled. \"I think of you almost as my own daughter. And I know the love you bear for \\nJoffrey.\" She gave a weary shake of her head. \"I am afraid we have some grave news about your lord \\nfather. You must be brave, child.\" \\nHer quiet words gave Sansa a chill. \"What is it?\" \\n\"Your father is a traitor, dear,\" Lord Varys said. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head. \"With my own ears, I heard Lord Eddard swear to our \\nbeloved King Robert that he would protect the young princes as if they were his own sons. And yet the \\nmoment the king was dead, he called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey\\'s rightful throne.\" \\n\"No,\" Sansa blurted. \"He wouldn\\'t do that. He wouldn\\'t!\" \\nThe queen picked up a letter. The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood, but the broken seal was her \\nfather\\'s, the direwolf stamped in pale wax. \"We found this on the captain of your household guard, \\nSansa. It is a letter to my late husband\\'s brother Stannis, inviting him to take the crown.\" \\n\"Please, Your Grace, there\\'s been a mistake.\" Sudden panic made her dizzy and faint. \"Please, send for \\nmy father, he\\'ll tell you, he would never write such a letter, the king was his friend.\" \\n\"Robert thought so,\" said the queen. \"This betrayal would have broken his heart. The gods are kind, that \\nhe did not live to see it.\" She sighed. \"Sansa, sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left \\nus in. You are innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor. How \\nPage 366\\n\\ncan I allow you to marry my son?\" \\n\"But I love him,\" Sansa wailed, confused and frightened. What did they mean to do to her? What had \\nthey done to her father? It was not supposed to happen this way. She had to wed Joffrey, they were \\nbetrothed, he was promised to her, she had even dreamed about it. It wasn\\'t fair to take him away from \\nher on account of whatever her father might have done. \\n\"How well I know that, child,\" Cersei said, her voice so kind and sweet. \"Why else should you have \\ncome to me and told me of your father\\'s plan to send you away from us, if not for love?\" \\n\"It was for love,\" Sansa said in a rush. \"Father wouldn\\'t even give me leave to say farewell.\" She was the \\ngood girl, the obedient girl, but she had felt as wicked as Arya that morning, sneaking away from Septa \\nMordane, defying her lord father. She had never done anything so willful before, and she would never \\nhave done it then if she hadn\\'t loved Joffrey as much as she did. \"He was going to take me back to \\nWinterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joff I wanted. I told him, but he \\nwouldn\\'t listen.\" The king had been her last hope. The king could command Father to let her stay in \\nKing\\'s Landing and marry Prince Joffrey, Sansa knew he could, but the king had always frightened her. \\nHe was loud and rough-voiced and drunk as often as not, and he would probably have just sent her back \\nto Lord Eddard, if they even let her see him. So she went to the queen instead, and poured out her heart, \\nand Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly . . . only then Ser Arys had escorted her to the high \\nroom in Maegor\\'s Holdfast and posted guards, and a few hours later, the fighting had begun outside. \\n\"Please,\" she finished, \"you have to let me marry Joffrey, I\\'ll be ever so good a wife to him, you\\'ll see. I\\'ll \\nbe a queen just like you, I promise.\" \\nQueen Cersei looked to the others. \"My lords of the council, what do you say to her plea?\" \\n\"The poor child,\" murmured Varys. \"A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, it would be cruel to deny \\nit . . . and yet, what can we do? \\nHer father stands condemned.\" His soft hands washed each other in a gesture of helpless distress. \\n\"A child born of traitor\\'s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her,\" said Grand Maester Pycelle. \\n\"She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can say what treasons she may hatch?\" \\n\"No, \" Sansa said, horrified. \"I\\'m not, I\\'d never . . . I wouldn\\'t betray Joffrey, I love him, I swear it, I \\ndo.\" \\n\"Oh, so poignant,\" said Varys. \"And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer than oaths.\" \\n\"She reminds me of the mother, not the father,\" Lord Petyr Baelish said quietly. \"Look at her. The hair, \\nthe eyes. She is the very image of Cat at the same age.\" \\nThe queen looked at her, troubled, and yet Sansa could see kindness in her clear green eyes. \"Child,\" \\nshe said, \"if I could truly believe that you were not like your father, why nothing should please me more \\nthan to see you wed to my Joffrey. I know he loves you with all his heart.\" She sighed. \"And yet, I fear \\nthat Lord Varys and the Grand Maester have the right of it. The blood will tell. I have only to remember \\nhow your sister set her wolf on my son.\" \\n\"I\\'m not like Arya,\" Sansa blurted. \"She has the traitor\\'s blood, not me. I\\'m good, ask Septa Mordane, \\nPage 367\\n\\nshe\\'ll tell you, I only want to be Joffrey\\'s loyal and loving wife.\" \\nShe felt the weight of Cersei\\'s eyes as the queen studied her face. \"I believe you mean it, child.\" She \\nturned to face the others. \"My lords, it seems to me that if the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this \\nterrible time, that would go a long way toward laying our fears to rest.\" \\nGrand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard, his wide brow furrowed in thought. \"Lord Eddard \\nhas three sons.\" \\n\"Mere boys,\" Lord Petyr said with a shrug. \"I should be more concerned with Lady Catelyn and the \\nTullys.\" \\nThe queen took Sansa\\'s hand in both of hers. \"Child, do you know your letters?\" \\nSansa nodded nervously. She could read and write better than any of her brothers, although she was \\nhopeless at sums. \\n\"I am pleased to hear that. Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still . . .\" \\n\"What do you want me to do?\" \\n\"You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldest . . . what is his name?\" \\n\"Robb,\" Sansa said. \\n\"The word of your lord father\\'s treason will no doubt reach them \\nsoon. Better that it should come from you. You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his king.\" \\nSansa wanted Joffrey desperately, but she did not think she had the courage to do as the queen was \\nasking. \"But he never . . . I don\\'t . . . Your Grace, I wouldn\\'t know what to say . . .\" \\nThe queen patted her hand. \"We will tell you what to write, child. The important thing is that you urge \\nLady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king\\'s peace.\" \\n\"It will go hard for them if they don\\'t,\" said Grand Maester Pycelle. \"By the love you bear them, you \\nmust urge them to walk the path of wisdom.\" \\n\"Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully,\" the queen said. \"You must tell her that you are \\nwell and in our care, that we are treating you gently and seeing to your every want. Bid them to come to \\nKing\\'s Landing and pledge their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne. If they do that . . . why, then \\nwe shall know that there is no taint in your blood, and when you come into the flower of your \\nwomanhood, you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor, before the eyes of gods and men.\" \\n. . . wed the king . . . The words made her breath come faster, yet still Sansa hesitated. \"Perhaps . . . if I \\nmight see my father, talk to him about . . .\" \\n\"Treason?\" Lord Varys hinted. \\nPage 368\\n\\n\"You disappoint me, Sansa,\" the queen said, with eyes gone hard as stones. \"We\\'ve told you of your \\nfather\\'s crimes. If you are truly as loyal as you say, why should you want to see him?\" \\n\"I . . . I only meant Sansa felt her eyes grow wet. \"He\\'s not \\n. . . please, he hasn\\'t been . . . hurt, or . . . or . . . \\n,:Lord Eddard has not been harmed,\" the queen said. But . . . what\\'s to become of him?\" \\n\"That is a matter for the king to decide,\" Grand Maester Pycelle announced ponderously. \\nThe king! Sansa blinked back her tears. Joffrey was the king now, she thought. Her gallant prince would \\nnever hurt her father, no matter what he might have done. If she went to him and pleaded for mercy, she \\nwas certain he\\'d listen. He had to listen, he loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish \\nFather, the lords would expect it, but perhaps he could send him back to Winterfell, or exile him to one \\nof the Free Cities across the narrow sea. It would only have to be for a few years. By then she and \\nJoffrey would be married. Once she was queen, she could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant \\nhim a pardon. \\nOnly ... if Mother or Robb did anything treasonous, called the banners or refused to swear fealty or \\nanything, it would all go wrong. Her Joffrey was good and kind, she knew it in her heart, but a king had \\nto be stern with rebels. She had to make them understand, she had to! \\n\"I\\'ll . I\\'ll write the letters,\" Sansa told them. \\nWith a smile as warm as the sunrise, Cersei Lannister leaned close and kissed her gently on the cheek. \"I \\nknew you would. Joffrey will be so proud when I tell him what courage and good sense you\\'ve shown \\nhere today.\" \\nIn the end, she wrote four letters. To her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, and to her brothers at \\nWinterfell, and to her aunt and her grandfather as well, Lady Lysa Arryn of the Eyrie, and Lord Hoster \\nTully of Riverrun. By the time she had done, her fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink. \\nVarys had her father\\'s seal. She warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle, poured it carefully, and \\nwatched as the eunuch stamped each letter with the direwolf of House Stark. \\nJeyne Poole and all her things were gone when Ser Mandon Moore returned Sansa to the high tower of \\nMaegor\\'s Holdfast. No more weeping, she thought gratefully. Yet somehow it seemed colder with Jeyne \\ngone, even after she\\'d built a fire. She pulled a chair close to the hearth, took down one of her favorite \\nbooks, and lost herself in the stories of Florian and Jonquil, of Lady Shella and the Rainbow Knight, of \\nvaliant Prince Aemon and his doomed love for his brother\\'s queen. \\nIt was not until later that night, as she was drifting off to sleep, that Sansa realized she had forgotten to \\nask about her sister. \\nJON \\n\"Othor,\" announced Ser Jaremy Rykker, \"beyond a doubt. And this one was Jafer Flowers.\" He turned \\nPage 369\\n\\nthe corpse over with his foot, and the dead white face stared up at the overcast sky with blue, blue eyes. \\n\"They were Ben Stark\\'s men, both of them.\" \\nMy uncle\\'s men, Jon thought numbly. He remembered how he\\'d pleaded to ride with them. Gods, I was \\nsuch a green boy. If he had taken me, it might be me lying here . . . \\nJafer\\'s right wrist ended in the ruin of torn flesh and splintered bone left by Ghost\\'sjaws. His right hand \\nwas floating in ajar of vinegar back in Maester Aemon\\'s tower. His left hand, still at the end of his arm, \\nwas as black as his cloak. \\n\"Gods have mercy,\" the Old Bear muttered. He swung down from his garron, handing his reins to Jon. \\nThe morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted the Lord Commander\\'s broad forehead like \\ndew on a melon. His horse was nervous, rolling her eyes, backing away from the dead men as far as her \\nlead would allow. Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting. The horses did not like \\nthe feel of this place. For that matter, neither did Jon. \\nThe dogs liked it least of all. Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds had been useless. When \\nBass the kennelmaster had tried to get them to take the scent from the severed hand, they had gone wild, \\nyowling and barking, fighting to get away. Even now they were snarling and whimpering by turns, pulling \\nat their leashes while Chett cursed them for curs. \\nIt is only a wood, Jon told himself, and they\\'re only dead men. He had seen dead men before . . . \\nLast night he had dreamt the Winterfell dream again. He was wandering the empty castle, searching for \\nhis father, descending into the crypts. Only this time the dream had gone further than before. In the dark \\nhe\\'d heard the scrape of stone on stone. When he turned he saw that the vaults were opening, one after \\nthe other. As the dead kings came stumbling from their cold black graves, Jon had woken in pitchdark, \\nhis heart hammering. Even when Ghost leapt up on the bed to nuzzle at his face, he could not shake his \\ndeep sense of terror. He dared not go back to sleep. Instead he had climbed the Wall and walked, \\nrestless, until he saw the light of the dawn off to the cast. It was only a dream. I am a brother of the \\nNight\\'s Watch now, not a ffightened boy. \\nSamwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, half-hidden behind the horses. His round fat face was the \\ncolor of curdled milk. So far he had not lurched off to the woods to retch, but he had not so much as \\nglanced at the dead men either. \"I can\\'t look,\" he whispered miserably. \\n\"You have to look,\" Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would not hear. \"Maester Aemon \\nsent you to be his eyes, didn\\'t he? What good are eyes if they\\'re shut?\" \\n\"Yes, but . . . I\\'m such a coward, Jon.\" \\nJon put a hand on Sam\\'s shoulder. \"We have a dozen rangers with us, and the dogs, even Ghost. No \\none will hurt you, Sam. Go ahead and look. The first look is the hardest.\" \\nSam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort. Slowly he swiveled his head. \\nHis eyes widened, but Jon held his arm so he could not turn away. \\n\"Ser Jaremy,\" the Old Bear asked gruffly, \"Ben Stark had six men with him when he rode from the Wall. \\nPage 370\\n\\nWhere are the others?\" \\nSer Jaremy shook his head. \"Would that I knew.\" \\nPlainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer. \"Two of our brothers butchered almost within sight \\nof the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw nothing. Is this what the Night\\'s Watch has fallen to? Do \\nwe still sweep these woods?\" \\n\"Yes, my lord, but-\" \\n\"Do we still mount watches?\" \\n\"We do, but-\" \\n\"This man wears a hunting horn.\" Mormont pointed at Othor. \"Must I suppose that he died without \\nsounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as blind?\" \\nSer Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger. \"No horn was blown, my lord, or my rangers would have \\nheard it. I do not have sufficient men to mount as many patrols as I should like . . . and since Benjen was \\nlost, we have stayed closer to the Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command.\" \\nThe Old Bear grunted. \"Yes. Well. Be that as it may.\" He made an impatient gesture. \"Tell me how they \\ndied.\" \\nSquatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy grasped his head by the scalp. \\nThe hair came out between his fingers, brittle as straw. The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the \\nheel of his hand. A great gash in the side of the corpse\\'s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried \\nblood. Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck. \"This was done with an axe.\" \\n\"Aye,\" muttered Dywen, the old forester. \"Belike the axe that Othor carried, m\\'lord.\" \\nJon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips together and made himself look \\nat the second body. Othor had been a big ugly man, and he made a big ugly corpse. No axe was in \\nevidence. Jon remembered Othor; he had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode \\nout. His singing days were done. His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere but his hands. His \\nhands were black like Jafer\\'s. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the mortal wounds that \\ncovered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. Yet his eyes were still open. They stared up at the \\nsky, blue as sapphires. \\nSer Jaremy stood. \"The wildlings have axes too.\" \\nMormont rounded on him. \"So you believe this is Mance Rayder\\'s work? This close to the Wall?\" \\n\"Who else, my lord?\" \\nJon could have told him. He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would say the words. The Others \\nare only a story, a tale to make children shiver. If they ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand \\nyears. Even the thought made him feel foolish; he was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night\\'s \\nWatch, not the boy who\\'d once sat at Old Nan\\'s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya. \\nPage 371\\n\\nYet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort. \"If Ben Stark had come under wildling attack a half day\\'s \\nride from Castle Black, he \\nwould have returned for more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their \\nheads.\" \\n\"Unless he was slain as well,\" Ser Jaremy insisted. \\nThe words hurt, even now. It had been so long, it seemed folly to cling to the hope that Ben Stark was \\nstill alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn. \\n\"It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord,\" Ser Jaremy went on. \"The forest is vast. \\nThe wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere. I\\'d wager these two were the last survivors of his party, \\non their way back to us . . . but the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall. \\nThe corpses are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a day \\n\"No, \" Samwell Tarly squeaked. \\nJon was startled. Sam\\'s nervous, high-pitched voice was the last he would have expected to hear. The \\nfat boy was frightened of the officers, and Ser Jaremy was not known for his patience. \\n\"I did not ask for your views, boy,\" Rykker said coldly. \\n\"Let him speak, ser,\" Jon blurted. \\nMormont\\'s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again. \"If the lad has something to say, I\\'ll hear him \\nout. Come closer, boy. We can\\'t see you behind those horses.\" \\nSam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely. \"My lord, it . . . it can\\'t be a day or . . . look . . \\n. the blood . . .\" \\n\"Yes?\" Mormont growled impatiently. \"Blood, what of it?\" \\n\"He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it,\" Chett shouted out, and the rangers laughed. \\nSam mopped at the sweat on his brow. \"You . . . you can see where Ghost . . . Jon\\'s direwolf . . . you \\ncan see where he tore off that man\\'s hand, and yet . . . the stump hasn\\'t bled, look . . .\" He waved a \\nhand. \"My father . . . L-lord Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, when . . . after \\n. . .\" Sam shook his head from side to side, his chins quivering. Now that he had looked at the bodies, he \\ncould not seem to look away. \"A fresh kill . . . the blood would still flow, my lords. Later . . . later it \\nwould be clotted, like a . . . a jelly, thick and . . . and . . .\" He looked as though he was going to be sick. \\n\"This man . . . look at the wrist, it\\'s all . . . crusty . . . dry . . . like . . . \" \\nJon saw at once what Sam meant. He could see the torn veins in the dead man\\'s wrist, iron worms in the \\npale flesh. His blood was a black dust. Yet Jaremy Rykker was unconvinced. \"If they\\'d been dead much \\nlonger than a day, they\\'d be ripe by now, boy. They don\\'t even smell.\" \\nDywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could \\nPage 372\\n\\nsmell snow coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff. \"Well, they\\'re no pansy flowers, \\nbut ... m\\'lord has the truth of it. There\\'s no corpse stink.\" \\n\"They . . . they aren\\'t rotting.\" Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little. \"Look, there\\'s . . . there\\'s \\nno maggots or . . . or . . . worms or anything . . . they\\'ve been lying here in the woods, but they . . . they \\nhaven\\'t been chewed or eaten by animals . . . only Ghost . . . otherwise they\\'re . . . they\\'re . . .\" \\n\"Untouched,\" Jon said softly. \"And Ghost is different. The dogs and the horses won\\'t go near them.\" \\nThe rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true, every man of them. Mormont frowned, \\nglancing from the corpses to the dogs. \"Chett, bring the hounds closer.\" \\nChett tried, cursing, yanking on the leashes, giving one animal a lick of his boot. Most of the dogs just \\nwhimpered and planted their feet. He tried dragging one. The bitch resisted, growling and squirming as if \\nto escape her collar. Finally she lunged at him. Chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward. The \\ndog leapt over him and bounded off into the trees. \\n\"This . . . this is all wrong,\" Sam Tarly said earnestly. \"The blood . . . there\\'s bloodstains on their clothes, \\nand . . . and their flesh, dry and hard, but . . . there\\'s none on the ground, or . . . anywhere. With those . . \\n. those . . . those . . .\" Sam made himself swallow, took a deep breath. \"With those wounds . . . terrible \\nwounds . . . there should be blood all over. Shouldn\\'t there?\" \\nDywen sucked at his wooden teeth. \"Might be they didn\\'t die here. Might be someone brought \\'ern and \\nleft \\'ern for us. A warning, as like.\" The old forester peered down suspiciously. \"And might be I\\'m a fool, \\nbut I don\\'t know that Othor never had no blue eyes afore.\" \\nSer Jaremy looked startled. \"Neither did Flowers,\" he blurted, turning to stare at the dead man. \\nA silence fell over the wood. For a moment all they heard was Sam\\'s heavy breathing and the wet sound \\nof Dywen sucking on his teeth. Jon squatted beside Ghost. \\n\"Bum them, \" someone whispered. One of the rangers; Jon could not have said who. \"Yes, burn them,\" a \\nsecond voice urged. \\nThe Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head. \"Not yet. I want Maester Aemon to have a look at \\nthem. We\\'ll bring them back to the Wall.\" \\nSome commands are more easily given than obeyed. They wrapped the dead men in cloaks, but when \\nHake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out \\nwith its hooves, even biting at Ketter when he ran to help. The rangers had no better luck with the other \\ngarrons; not even the most placid wanted any part of these burdens. In the end they were forced to hack \\noff branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot. It was well past midday by the \\ntime they started back. \\n\"I will have these woods searched,\" Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they set out. \"Every tree, \\nPage 373\\n\\nevery rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within ten leagues of here. Use all the men you \\nhave, and if you do not have enough, borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards. If Ben and the \\nothers are out here, dead or alive, I will have them found. And if there is anyone else in these woods, I \\nwill know of it. You are to track them and take them, alive if possible. Is that understood?\" \\n\"It is, my lord,\" Ser Jaremy said. \"It will be done.\" \\nAfter that, Mormont rode in silence, brooding. Jon followed close behind him; as the Lord \\nCommander\\'s steward, that was his place. The day was grey, damp, overcast, the sort of day that made \\nyou wish for rain. No wind stirred the wood; the air hung humid and heavy, and Jon\\'s clothes clung to his \\nskin. It was warm. Too warm. The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and \\nsometimes Jon even imagined it was shrinking. \\nThe old men called this weather spirit summer, and said it meant the season was giving up its ghosts at \\nlast. After this the cold would come, they warned, and a long summer always meant a long winter. This \\nsummer had lasted ten years. Jon had been a babe in arms when it began. \\nGhost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees. Without the direwolf, Jon felt almost \\nnaked. He found himself glancing at every shadow with unease. Unbidden, he thought back on the tales \\nthat Old Nan used to tell them, when he was a boy at Winterfell. He could almost hear her voice again, \\nand the click-click-click of her needles. In that darkness, the Others came riding, she used to say, \\ndropping her voice lower and lower. Cold and dead they were, and they hated iron and fire and the \\ntouch of the sun, and every living creature with hot blood in its veins. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms \\nof men allfell before them, as they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed \\ntheir dead servants on the flesh of human children . . . \\nWhen he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an ancient gnarled oak, Jon was \\nvastly relieved. Mormont reined up suddenly and turned in his saddle. \"Tarly,\" he barked, \"come here.\" \\nJon saw the start of fright on Sam\\'s face as he lumbered up on his mare; doubtless he thought he was in \\ntrouble. \"You\\'re fat but you\\'re \\nnot stupid, boy,\" the Old Bear said gruffly. \"You did well back there. And you, Snow.\" \\nSam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to stammer out a courtesy. Jon \\nhad to smile. \\nWhen they emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred his tough little garron to a trot. Ghost came \\nstreaking out from the woods to meet them, licking his chops, his muzzle red from prey. High above, the \\nmen on the Wall saw the column approaching. Jon heard the deep, throaty call of the watchman\\'s great \\nhorn, calling out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed off the \\nice. \\nUUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo. \\nThe sound faded slowly to silence. One blast meant rangers returning, and Jon thought, I was a rangerfor \\none day, at least. Whatever may come, they cannot take that away from me. \\nBowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through the icy tunnel. The Lord \\nPage 374\\n\\nSteward was red-faced and agitated. \"My lord,\" he blurted at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars, \\n\"there\\'s been a bird, you must come at once.\" \\n\"What is it, man?\" Mormont said gruffly. \\nCuriously, Marsh glanced at Jon before he answered. \"Maester Aemon has the letter. He\\'s waiting in \\nyour solar.\" \\n\"Very well. Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a storeroom until the \\nmaester is ready for them.\" Mormont strode away grumbling. \\nAs they led their horses back to the stable, Jon was uncomfortably aware that people were watching \\nhim. Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling his boys in the yard, but he broke off to stare at Jon, a faint half smile \\non his lips. One-armed Donal Noye stood in the door of the armory. \"The gods be with you, Snow,\" he \\ncalled out. \\nSomething\\'s wrong, Jon thought. Something\\'s very wrong. \\nThe dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the Wall, a dark cold cell \\nchiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and sometimes even beer. Jon saw that \\nMormont\\'s horse was fed and watered and groomed before he took care of his own. Afterward he \\nsought out his friends. Grenn and Toad were on watch, but he found Pyp in the common hall. \"What\\'s \\nhappened?\" he asked. \\nPyp lowered his voice. \"The king\\'s dead.\" \\nJon was stunned. Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited Winterfell, yet he\\'d seemed \\nhale enough, and there\\'d been no talk of illness. \"How can you know?\" \\n\"One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon.\" Pyp leaned close. \"Jon, I\\'m \\nsorry. He was your father\\'s friend, wasn\\'t he?\" \\n\"They were as close as brothers, once.\" Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep his father as the King\\'s \\nHand. It did not seem likely. That might mean Lord Eddard would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as \\nwell. He might even be allowed to visit them, with Lord Mormont\\'s permission. It would be good to see \\nArya\\'s grin again and to talk with his father. I will ask him about my mother, he resolved. I am a man \\nnow, it is past time he told me. Even if she was a whore, I don\\'t care, I want to know. \\n\"I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncle\\'s,\" Pyp said. \\n\"Yes,\" Jon replied. \"Two of the six he took with him. They\\'d been dead a long time, only . . . the bodies \\nare queer.\" \\n\"Queer?\" Pyp was all curiosity. \"How queer?\" \\n\"Sam will tell you.\" Jon did not want to talk of it. \"I should see if the Old Bear has need of me.\" \\nHe walked to the Lord Commander\\'s Tower alone, with a curious sense of apprehension. The brothers \\non guard eyed him solemnly as he approached. \"The Old Bear\\'s in his solar,\" one of them announced. \\nPage 375\\n\\n\"He was asking for you.\" \\nJon nodded. He should have come straight from the stable. He climbed the tower steps briskly. He \\nwants wine or a fire in his hearth, that\\'s all, he told himself. \\nWhen he entered the solar, Mormont\\'s raven screamed at him. \"Corn!\" the bird shrieked. \"Corn! Corn! \\nCorn!\" \\n\"Don\\'t you believe it, I just fed him,\" the Old Bear growled. He was seated by the window, reading a \\nletter. \"Bring me a cup of wine, and pour one for yourself.\" \\n\"For myself, my lord?\" \\nMormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon. There was pity in that look; he could taste it. \"You \\nheard me.\" \\nJon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that he was drawing out the act. When the cups were \\nfilled, he would have no choice but to face whatever was in that letter. Yet all too soon, they were filled. \\n\"Sit, boy,\" Mormont commanded him. \"Drink.\" \\nJon remained standing. \"It\\'s my father, isn\\'t it?\" \\nThe Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger. \"Your father and the king,\" he rumbled. \"I won\\'t lie to you, \\nit\\'s grievous news. I never thought to see another king, not at my age, with Robert half my years and \\nstrong as a bull.\" He took a gulp of wine. \"They say the king loved to hunt. The things we love destroy us \\nevery time, lad. Remember that. \\nMy son loved that young wife of his. Vain woman. If not for her, he would never have thought to sell \\nthose poachers.\" \\nJon could scarcely follow what he was saying. \"My lord, I don\\'t understand. What\\'s happened to my \\nfather?\" \\n\"I told you to sit,\" Mormont grumbled. \"Sit, \" the raven screamed. \"And have a drink, damn you. That\\'s \\na command, Snow.\" \\nJon sat, and took a sip of wine. \\n\"Lord Eddard has been imprisoned. He is charged with treason. It is said he plotted with Robert\\'s \\nbrothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.\" \\n\"No,\" Jon said at once. \"That couldn\\'t be. My father would never betray the king!\" \\n\"Be that as it may,\" said Mormont. \"It is not for me to say. Nor for you.,, \\n\"But it\\'s a lie,\" Jon insisted. How could they think his father was a traitor, had they all gone mad? Lord \\nEddard Stark would never dishonor himself . . . would he? \\nHe fathered a bastard, a small voice whispered inside him. Where was the honor in that? And your \\nPage 376\\n\\nmother, what of her? He will not even speak her name. \\n\"My lord, what will happen to him? Will they kill him?\" \\n\"As to that, I cannot say, lad. I mean to send a letter. I knew some of the king\\'s councillors in my youth. \\nOld Pycelle, Lord Stannis, Ser Barristan . . . Whatever your father has done, or hasn\\'t done, he is a great \\nlord. He must be allowed to take the black and join us here. Gods knows, we need men of Lord \\nEddard\\'s ability.\" \\nJon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their honor on the Wall in \\ndays past. Why not Lord Eddard? His father here. That was a strange thought, and strangely \\nuncomfortable. It would be a monstrous injustice to strip him of Winterfell and force him to take the \\nblack, and yet if it meant his life . . . \\nAnd would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way he\\'d mocked Robb and \\nSer Rodrik in the yard. Jon himself he had scarcely even noticed; bastards were beneath even his \\ncontempt. \"My lord, will the king listen to you?\" \\nThe Old Bear shrugged. \"A boy king . . . I imagine he\\'ll listen to his mother. A pity the dwarf isn\\'t with \\nthem. He\\'s the lad\\'s uncle, and he saw our need when he visited us. It was a bad thing, your lady mother \\ntaking him captive-\" \\n\"Lady Stark is not my mother,\" Jon reminded him sharply. Tyrion Lannister had been a friend to him. If \\nLord Eddard was killed, she \\nwould be as much to blame as the queen. \"My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with \\nmy father, do you know-\" \\n\"Pycelle makes no mention of them, but doubtless they\\'ll be treated gently. I will ask about them when I \\nwrite.\" Mormont shook his head. \"This could not have happened at a worse time. If ever the realm \\nneeded a strong king . . . there are dark days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bones . . .\" He gave \\nJon a long shrewd look. \"I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid, boy.\" \\nHe\\'s myfather, Jon wanted to say, but he knew that Mormont would not want to hear it. His throat was \\ndry. He made himself take another sip of wine. \\n\"Your duty is here now,\" the Lord Commander reminded him. \"Your old life ended when you took the \\nblack.\" His bird made a raucous echo. \"Black. \" Mormont took no notice. \"Whatever they do in King\\'s \\nLanding is none of our concern.\" When Jon did not answer, the old man finished his wine and said, \\n\"You\\'re free to go. I\\'ll have no further need of you today. On the morrow you can help me write that \\nletter.\" \\nJon did not remember standing or leaving the solar. The next he knew, he was descending the tower \\nsteps, thinking, This is my father, my sisters, how can it be none of my concern? \\nOutside, one of the guards looked at him and said, \"Be strong, boy. The gods are cruel.\" \\nThey know, Jon realized. \"My father is no traitor,\" he said hoarsely. Even the words stuck in his throat, \\nas if to choke him. The wind was rising, and it seemed colder in the yard than it had when he\\'d gone in. \\nPage 377\\n\\nSpirit summer was drawing to an end. \\nThe rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream. Jon could not have said where he walked, what he did, \\nwho he spoke with. Ghost was with him, he knew that much. The silent presence of the direwolf gave \\nhim comfort. The girls do not even have that much, he thought. Their wolves might have kept them safe, \\nbut Lady is dead and Nymeria\\'s lost, they\\'re all alone. \\nA north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down. Jon could hear it skirling against the \\nWall and over the icy battlements as he went to the common hall for the evening meal. Hobb had cooked \\nup a venison stew, thick with barley, onions, and carrots. When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon\\'s \\nplate and gave him the crusty heel of the bread, he knew what it meant. He knows. He looked around \\nthe hall, saw heads turn quickly, eyes politely averted. They all know. \\nHis friends rallied to him. \"We asked the septon to light a candle for your father,\" Matthar told him. \"It\\'s \\na lie, we all know it\\'s a lie, even \\nGrenn knows it\\'s a lie,\" Pyp chimed in. Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon\\'s hand, \"You\\'re my brother \\nnow, so he\\'s my father too,\" the fat boy said. \"If you want to go out to the weirwoods and pray to the old \\ngods, I\\'ll go with you.\" \\nThe weirwoods were beyond the Wall, yet he knew Sam meant what he said. They are my brothers, he \\nthought. As much as Robb and Bran and Rickon . . . \\nAnd then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser Alliser Thorne. \"Not \\nonly a bastard, but a traitor\\'s bastard,\" he was telling the men around him. \\nIn the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp made a grab for him, but \\nhe wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down the table and kicking the bowl from Ser \\nAlliser\\'s hand. Stew went flying everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were \\nshouting, but Jon Snow did not hear them. He lunged at Ser Alliser\\'s face with the dagger, slashing at \\nthose cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could get around him, Pyp \\nwas on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife \\nfrom his fingers. \\nLater, much later, after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell, Mormont came down to see him, \\nraven on his shoulder. \"I told you not to do anything stupid, boy,\" the Old Bear said. \"Boy, \" the bird \\nchorused. Mormont shook his head, disgusted. \"And to think I had high hopes for you.\" \\nThey took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell until the high officers met to \\ndecide what was to be done with him. And then they placed a guard outside his door to make certain he \\nobeyed. His friends were not allowed to see him, but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost, so \\nhe was not utterly alone. \\n\"My father is no traitor,\" he told the direwolf when the rest had gone. Ghost looked at him in silence. Jon \\nslumped against the wall, hands around his knees, and stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow \\nbed. The flame flickered and swayed, the shadows moved around him, the room seemed to grow darker \\nand colder. I will not sleep tonight, Jon thought. \\nYet he must have dozed. When he woke, his legs were stiff and cramped and the candle had long since \\nPage 378\\n\\nburned out. Ghost stood on his hind legs, scrabbling at the door. Jon was startled to see how tall he\\'d \\ngrown. \"Ghost, what is it?\" he called softly. The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him, baring \\nhis fangs in a silent snarl. Has he gone mad? Jon wondered. \"It\\'s me, Ghost,\" he murmured, trying not \\nto sound afraid. Yet he was trembling, violently. When had it gotten so cold? \\nGhost backed away from the door. There were deep gouges where he\\'d raked the wood. Jon watched \\nhim with mounting disquiet. \"There\\'s someone out there, isn\\'t there?\" he whispered. Crouching, the \\ndirewolf crept backward, white fur rising on the back of his neck. The guard, he thought, they left a man \\nto guard my door, Ghost smells him through the door, that\\'s all it is. \\nSlowly, Jon pushed himself to his feet. He was shivering uncontrollably, wishing he still had a sword. \\nThree quick steps brought him to the door. He grabbed the handle and pulled it inward. The creak of the \\nhinges almost made him jump. \\nHis guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps, looking up at him. Looking up at him, even \\nthough he was lying on his stomach. His head had been twisted completely around. \\nIt can\\'t be, Jon told himself. This is the Lord Commander\\'s Tower, it\\'s guarded day and night, this \\ncouldn\\'t happen, it\\'s a dream, I\\'m having a nightmare. \\nGhost slid past him, out the door. The wolf started up the steps, stopped, looked back at Jon. That was \\nwhen he heard it; the soft scrape of a boot on stone, the sound of a latch turning. The sounds came from \\nabove. From the Lord Commander\\'s chambers. \\nA nightmare this might be, yet it was no dream. \\nThe guard\\'s sword was in its sheath. Jon knelt and worked it free. The heft of steel in his fist made him \\nbolder. He moved up the steps, Ghost padding silently before him. Shadows lurked in every turn of the \\nstair. Jon crept up warily, probing any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword. \\nSuddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont\\'s raven. \"Corn, \" the bird was screaming. \"Corn, corn, corn, \\ncorn, corn, corn. \" Ghost bounded ahead, and Jon came scrambling after. The door to Mormont\\'s solar \\nwas wide open. The direwolf plunged through. Jon stopped in the doorway, blade in hand, giving his \\neyes a moment to adjust. Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows, and the darkness was \\nblack as ink. \"Who\\'s there?\" he called out. \\nThen he saw it, a shadow in the shadows, sliding toward the inner door that led to Mormont\\'s sleeping \\ncell, a man-shape all in black, cloaked and hooded . . . but beneath the hood, its eyes shone with an icy \\nblue radiance . . . \\nGhost leapt. Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, rolling, smashing into a \\nchair, knocking over a table laden with papers. Mormont\\'s raven was flapping overhead, screaming, \\n\"Corn, corn, corn, corn. \" Jon felt as blind as Maester Aemon. Keeping the wall to his back, he slid \\ntoward the window and ripped down the curtain. Moonlight flooded the solar. He glimpsed black hands \\nburied in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf\\'s throat. Ghost was twisting and \\nPage 379\\n\\nsnapping, legs flailing in the air, but he could not break free. \\nJon had no time to be afraid. He threw himself forward, shouting, bringing down the longsword with all \\nhis weight behind it. Steel sheared through sleeve and skin and bone, yet the sound was wrong somehow. \\nThe smell that engulfed him was so queer and cold he almost gagged. He saw arm and hand on the floor, \\nblack fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight. Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and crept away, \\nred tongue lolling from his mouth. \\nThe hooded man lifted his pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without hesitation. The sword laid the \\nintruder open to the bone, taking off half his nose and opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, \\neyes, eyes like blue stars burning. Jon knew that face. Othor, he thought, reeling back. Gods, he\\'s dead, \\nhe\\'s dead, I saw him dead. \\nHe felt something scrabble at his ankle. Black fingers clawed at his calf. The arm was crawling up his leg, \\nripping at wool and flesh. Shouting with revulsion, Jon pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his \\nsword and flipped the thing away. It lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. \\nThe corpse lurched forward. There was no blood. One-armed, face cut near in half, it seemed to feel \\nnothing. Jon held the longsword before him. \"Stay away!\" he commanded, his voice gone shrill. \"Corn, \" \\nscreamed the raven, \"corn, corn. \" The severed arm was wriggling out of its torn sleeve, a pale snake \\nwith a black five-fingered head. Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth. Finger bones crunched. Jon \\nhacked at the corpse\\'s neck, felt the steel bite deep and hard. \\nDead Othor slammed into him, knocking him off his feet. \\nJon\\'s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his shoulder blades. The sword, \\nwhere was the sword? He\\'d lost the damned sword! When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight \\njammed its black corpse fingers into Jon\\'s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was \\ntoo heavy. Its hand forced itself farther down his throat, icy cold, choking him. Its face was against his \\nown, filling the world. Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue. Jon raked cold flesh with his nails and \\nkicked at the thing\\'s legs. He tried to bite, tried to punch, tried to breathe . . . \\nAnd suddenly the corpse\\'s weight was gone, its fingers ripped from his throat. It was all Jon could do to \\nroll over, retching and shaking. \\nGhost had it again. He watched as the direwolf buried his teeth in the wight\\'s gut and began to rip and \\ntear. He watched, only half conscious, for a long moment before he finally remembered to look for his \\nsword . . . \\n* * \\' and saw Lord Mormont, naked and groggy from sleep, standing in the doorway with an oil lamp in \\nhand. Gnawed and fingerless, the arm thrashed on the floor, wriggling toward him. \\nJon tried to shout, but his voice was gone. Staggering to his feet, he kicked the arm away and snatched \\nthe lamp from the Old Bear\\'s fingers. The flame flickered and almost died. \"Bum!\" the raven cawed. \\n\"Bum, bum, bum!\" \\nSpinning, Jon saw the drapes he\\'d ripped from the window. He flung the lamp into the puddled cloth \\nwith both hands. Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, and the hangings went up in a great \\nwhoosh of flame. The heat of it on his face was sweeter than any kiss Jon had ever known. \"Ghost!\" he \\nPage 380\\n\\nshouted. \\nThe direwolf wrenched free and came to him as the wight struggled to rise, dark snakes spilling from the \\ngreat wound in its belly. Jon plunged his hand into the flames, grabbed a fistful of the burning drapes, and \\nwhipped them at the dead man. Let it bum, he prayed as the cloth smothered the corpse, gods, please, \\nplease, let it bum. \\nBRAN \\nThe Karstarks came in on a cold windy morning, bringing three hundred horsemen and near two \\nthousand foot from their castle at Karhold. The steel points of their pikes winked in the pale sunlight as \\nthe column approached. A man went before them, pounding out a slow, deep-throated marching rhythm \\non a drum that was bigger than he was, boom, boom, boom. \\nBran watched them come from a guard turret atop the outer wall, peering through Maester Luwin\\'s \\nbronze far-eye while perched on Hodor\\'s shoulders. Lord Rickard himself led them, his sons Harrion and \\nEddard and Torrhen riding beside him beneath night-black banners emblazoned with the white sunburst \\nof their House. Old Nan said they had Stark blood in them, going back hundreds of years, but they did \\nnot look like Starks to Bran. They were big men, and fierce, faces covered with thick beards, hair worn \\nloose past the shoulders. Their cloaks were made of skins, the pelts of bear and sea] and wolf. \\nThey were the last, he knew. The other lords were already here, with their hosts. Bran yearned to ride \\nout among them, to see the winter houses full to bursting, the jostling crowds in the market square every \\nmorning, the streets rutted and torn by wheel and hoof. But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle. \\n\"We have no men to spare to guard you,\" his brother had explained. \\n\"I\\'ll take Summer,\" Bran argued. \\n\"Don\\'t act the boy with me, Bran,\" Robb said. \"You know better than that. Only two days ago one of \\nLord Bolton\\'s men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn\\'s at the Smoking Log. Our lady mother would skin me for \\na pelt if I let you put yourself at risk.\" He was using the voice of Robb the Lord when he said it; Bran \\nknew that meant there was no appeal. \\nIt was because of what had happened in the wolfswood, he knew. The memory still gave him bad \\ndreams. He had been as helpless as a baby, no more able to defend himself than Rickon would have \\nbeen. Less, even . . . Rickon would have kicked them, at the least. It shamed him. He was only a few \\nyears younger than Robb; if his brother was almost a man grown, so was he. He should have been able \\nto protect himself. \\nA year ago, before, he would have visited the town even if it meant climbing over the walls by himself. In \\nthose days he could run down stairs, get on and off his pony by himself, and wield a wooden sword good \\nenough to knock Prince Tommen in the dirt. Now he could only watch, peering out through Maester \\nLuwin\\'s lens tube. The maester had taught him all the banners: the mailed fist of the Glovers, silver on \\nscarlet; Lady Mormont\\'s black bear; the hideous flayed man that went before Roose Bolton of the \\nDreadfort; a bull moose for the Hornwoods; a battle-axe for the Cerwyns; three sentinel trees for the \\nTallharts; and the fearsome sigil of House Umber, a roaring giant in shattered chains. \\nPage 381\\n\\nAnd soon enough he learned the faces too, when the lords and their sons and knights retainer came to \\nWinterfell to feast. Even the Great Hall was not large enough to seat all of them at once, so Robb hosted \\neach of the principal bannermen in turn. Bran was always given the place of honor at his brother\\'s right \\nhand. Some of the lords bannermen gave him queer hard stares as he sat there, as if they wondered by \\nwhat right a green boy should be placed above them, and him a cripple too. \\n\"How many is it now?\" Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and his sons rode through the \\ngates in the outer wall. \\n\"Twelve thousand men, or near enough as makes no matter.\" \\n\"How many knights?\" \\n\"Few enough,\" the maester said with a touch of impatience. \"To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in \\na sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows. In the north, only a few of the great \\nhouses worship the Seven. The rest honor the old gods, and name no knights . . . but those lords and \\ntheir sons and sworn swords are no \\nless fierce or loyal or honorable. A man\\'s worth is not marked by a ser before his name. As I have told \\nyou a hundred times before.\" \\n\"Still,\" said Bran, \"how many knights?\" \\nMaester Luwin sighed. \"Three hundred, perhaps four . . . among three thousand armored lances who are \\nnot knights.\" \\n\"Lord Karstark is the last,\" Bran said thoughtfully. \"Robb will feast him tonight.\" \\n\"No doubt he will.\" \\n\"How long before . . . before they go?\" \\n\"He must march soon, or not at all,\" Maester Luwin said. \"The winter town is full to bursting, and this \\narmy of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here much longer. Others are waiting to join him all \\nalong the kingsroad, barrow knights and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint. The fighting has \\nbegun in the riverlands, and your brother has many leagues to go.\" \\n\"I know.\" Bran felt as miserable as he sounded. He handed the bronze tube back to the maester, and \\nnoticed how thin Luwin\\'s hair had grown on top. He could see the pink of scalp showing through. It felt \\nqueer to look down on him this way, when he\\'d spent his whole life looking up at him, but when you sat \\non Hodor\\'s back you looked down on everyone. \"I don\\'t want to watch anymore. Hodor, take me back \\nto the keep.\" \\n\"Hodor,\" said Hodor. \\nMaester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve. \"Bran, your lord brother will not have time to see you \\nnow. He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them welcome.\" \\n\"I won\\'t trouble Robb. I want to visit the godswood.\" He put his hand on Hodor\\'s shoulder. \"Hodor.\" \\nPage 382\\n\\nA series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower\\'s inner wall. Hodor hummed \\ntunelessly as he went down hand under hand, Bran bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that \\nMaester Luwin had fashioned for him. Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to \\ncarry firewood on their backs; after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and attaching \\nsome new straps to spread Bran\\'s weight more evenly. It was not as good as riding Dancer, but there \\nwere places Dancer could not go, and this did not shame Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in \\nhis arms like a baby. Hodor seemed to like it too, though with Hodor it was hard to tell. The only tricky \\npart was doors. Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back, and that could be painful when \\nhe went through a door. \\nFor near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings \\nthat Robb ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them, even in the dead \\nof night. A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between the walls when Bran emerged \\nfrom the tower; Karstark men, following their lords into the castle. They wore black iron halfhelms and \\nblack woolen cloaks patterned with the white sunburst. Hodor trotted along beside them, smiling to \\nhimself, his boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge. The riders gave them queer looks as they \\nwent by, and once Bran heard someone guffaw. He refused to let it trouble him. \"Men will look at you,\" \\nMaester Luwin had warned him the first time they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor\\'s chest. \\n\"They will look, and they will talk, and some will mock you.\" Let them mock, Bran thought. No one \\nmocked him in his bedchamber, but he would not live his life in bed. \\nAs they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis, Bran put two fingers into his mouth and whistled. \\nSummer came loping across the yard. Suddenly the Karstark lancers were fighting for control, as their \\nhorses rolled their eyes and whickered in dismay. One stallion reared, screaming, his rider cursing and \\nhanging on desperately. The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they were not \\naccustomed to it, but they\\'d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone. \"The godswood,\" Bran \\nreminded Hodor. \\nEven Winterfell itself was crowded. The yard rang to the sound of sword and axe, the rumble of \\nwagons, and the barking of dogs. The armory doors were open, and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge, \\nhis hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his bare chest. Bran had never seen as many strangers in all his \\nyears, not even when King Robert had come to visit Father. \\nHe tried not to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door. They walked down a long dim hallway, \\nSummer padding easily beside them. The wolf glanced up from time to time, eyes smoldering like liquid \\ngold. Bran would have liked to touch him, but he was riding too high for his hand to reach. \\nThe godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had become. Hodor made his \\nway through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and sentinels, to the still pool beside the heart tree. \\nHe stopped under the gnarled limbs of the weirwood, humming. Bran reached up over his head and \\npulled himself out of his seat, drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker \\nbasket. He hung for a moment, dangling, the dark red leaves brushing against his face, until Hodor lifted \\nhim and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water. \"I want to be by myself for a while,\" he said. \\n\"You go soak. Go to the pools.\" \\nPage 383\\n\\n\"Hodor.\" Hodor stomped through the trees and vanished. Across the godswood, beneath the windows \\nof the Guest House, an underground hot spring fed three small ponds. Steam rose from the water day \\nand night, and the wall that loomed above was thick with moss. Hodor hated cold water, and would fight \\nlike a treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but he would happily immerse himself in the hottest pool \\nand sit for hours, giving a loud burp to echo the spring whenever a bubble rose from the murky green \\ndepths to break upon the surface. \\nSummer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran\\'s side. He rubbed the wolf under the jaw, and for \\na moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had always liked the godswood, even before, but of \\nlate he found himself drawn to it more and more. Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used \\nto. The deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took comfort from \\nthat now. The gods were looking over him, he told himself; the old gods, gods of the Starks and the First \\nMen and the children of the forest, hisfather\\'s gods. He felt safe in their sight, and the deep silence of the \\ntrees helped him think. Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall; thinking, and dreaming, and talking with \\nthe gods. \\n\"Please make it so Robb won\\'t go away,\" he prayed softly. He moved his hand through the cold water, \\nsending ripples across the pool. \"Please make him stay. Or if he has to go, bring him home safe, with \\nMother and Father and the girls. And make it . . . make it so Rickon understands.\" \\nHis baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned Robb was riding off to war, weeping \\nand angry by turns. He\\'d refused to eat, cried and screamed for most of a night, even punched Old Nan \\nwhen she tried to sing him to sleep, and the next day he\\'d vanished. Robb had set half the castle \\nsearching for him, and when at last they\\'d found him down in the crypts, Rickon had slashed at them with \\na rusted iron sword he\\'d snatched from a dead king\\'s hand, and Shaggydog had come slavering out of \\nthe darkness like a green-eyed demon. The wolf was near as wild as Rickon; he\\'d bitten Gage on the \\narm and torn a chunk of flesh from Mikken\\'s thigh. It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring \\nhim to bay. Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now, and Rickon cried all the more for \\nbeing without him. \\nMaester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded with him too, for his own \\nsake as much as Rickon\\'s, but his brother only shook his head stubbornly and said, \"I don\\'t want to go. I \\nhave to.\" \\nIt was only half a lie. Someone had to go, to hold the Neck and help the Tullys against the Lannisters, \\nBran could understand that, but it did not have to be Robb. His brother might have given the command to \\nHal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy, or to one of his lords bannermen. Maester Luwin urged him to do just \\nthat, but Robb would not hear of it. \"My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he \\nhuddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell,\" he said, all Robb the Lord. \\nRobb seemed half a stranger to Bran now, transformed, a lord in truth, though he had not yet seen his \\nsixteenth name day. Even their father\\'s bannermen seemed to sense it. Many tried to test him, each in his \\nown way. Roose Bolton and Robett Glover both demanded the honor of battle command, the first \\nbrusquely, the second with a smile and a jest. Stout, grey-haired Maege Mormont, dressed in mail like a \\nman, told Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson, and had no business giving her \\ncommands . . . but as it happened, she had a granddaughter she would be willing to have him marry. \\nSoftspoken Lord Cerwyn had actually brought his daughter with him, a plump, homely maid of thirty \\nyears who sat at her father\\'s left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate. Jovial Lord Hornwood \\nhad no daughters, but he did bring gifts, a horse one day, a haunch of venison the next, a silver-chased \\nPage 384\\n\\nhunting horn the day after, and he asked nothing in return . . . nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his \\ngrandfather, and hunting rights north of a certain ridge, and leave to dam the White Knife, if it please the \\nlord. \\nRobb answered each of them with cool courtesy, much as Father might have, and somehow he bent \\nthem to his will. \\nAnd when Lord Umber, who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as tall as Hodor and twice \\nas wide, threatened to take his forces home if he was placed behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in \\nthe order of march, Robb told him he was welcome to do so. \"And when we are done with the \\nLannisters,\" he promised, scratching Grey Wind behind the ear, \"we will march back north, root you out \\nof your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker.\" Cursing, the Greatjon flung a flagon of ale into the fire \\nand bellowed that Robb was so green he must piss grass. When Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him, he \\nknocked him to the floor, kicked over a table, and unsheathed the biggest, ugliest greatsword that Bran \\nhad ever seen. All along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet, \\ngrabbing for their steel. \\nYet Robb only said a quiet word, and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord Umber was on his back, \\nhis sword spinning on the floor three \\nfeet away and his hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers. \"My lord father \\ntaught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord,\" Robb said, \"but doubtless you only \\nmeant to cut my meat.\" Bran\\'s bowels went to water as the Greatjon struggled to rise, sucking at the red \\nstumps of fingers . . . but then, astonishingly, the huge man laughed. \"Your meat,\" he roared, \"is bloody \\ntough. \" \\nAnd somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb\\'s right hand, his staunchest champion, loudly telling \\nall and sundry that the boy lord was a Stark after all, and they\\'d damn well better bend their knees if they \\ndidn\\'t fancy having them chewed off. \\nYet that very night, his brother came to Bran\\'s bedchamber pale and shaken, after the fires had burned \\nlow in the Great Hall. \"I thought he was going to kill me,\" Robb confessed. \"Did you see the way he \\nthrew down Hal, like he was no bigger than Rickon? Gods, I was so scared. And the Greatjon\\'s not the \\nworst of them, only the loudest. Lord Roose never says a word, he only looks at me, and all I can think \\nof is that room they have in the Dreadfort, where the Boltons hang the skins of their enemies.\" \\n\"That\\'s just one of Old Nan\\'s stories,\" Bran said. A note of doubt crept into his voice. \"Isn\\'t it?\" \\n\"I don\\'t know.\" He gave a weary shake of his head. \"Lord Cerwyn means to take his daughter south \\nwith us. To cook for him, he says. Theon is certain I\\'ll find the girl in my bedroll one night. I wish . . . I \\nwish Father was here . . .\" \\nThat was the one thing they could agree on, Bran and Rickon and Robb the Lord; they all wished Father \\nwas here. But Lord Eddard was a thousand leagues away, a captive in some dungeon, a hunted fugitive \\nrunning for his life, or even dead. No one seemed to know for certain; every traveler told a different tale, \\neach more terrifying than the last. The heads of Father\\'s guardsmen were rotting on the walls of the Red \\nKeep, impaled on spikes. King Robert was dead at Father\\'s hands. The Baratheons had laid siege to \\nKing\\'s Landing. Lord Eddard had fled south with the king\\'s wicked brother Renly. Arya and Sansa had \\nbeen murdered by the Hound. Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung his body from the walls of \\nPage 385\\n\\nRiverrun. Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie, burning and slaughtering as he went. One \\nwinesodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the dead and was \\nmarshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to reclaim his father\\'s throne. \\nWhen the raven came, bearing a letter marked with Father\\'s own seal and written in Sansa\\'s hand, the \\ncruel truth seemed no less incredible. \\nBran would never forget the look on Robb\\'s face as he stared at their sister\\'s words. \"She says \\nFather conspired at treason with the king\\'s brothers,\" he read. \"King Robert is dead, and Mother and I \\nare summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey. She says we must be loyal, and when she \\nmarries Jofftey she will plead with him to spare our lord father\\'s life.\" His fingers closed into a fist, \\ncrushing Sansa\\'s letter between them. \"And she says nothing of Arya, nothing, not so much as a word. \\nDamn her! What\\'s wrong with the girl?\" \\nBran felt all cold inside. \"She lost her wolf,\" he said, weakly, remembering the day when four of his \\nfather\\'s guardsmen had returned from the south with Lady\\'s bones. Summer and Grey Wind and \\nShaggydog had begun to howl before they crossed the drawbridge, in voices drawn and desolate. \\nBeneath the shadow of the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, \\nwhere the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants. It was there they buried Lady, while her \\nbrothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. She had gone south, and only her bones had \\nreturned. \\nTheir grandfather, old Lord Rickard, had gone as well, with his son Brandon who was Father\\'s brother, \\nand two hundred of his best men. None had ever returned. And Father had gone south, with Arya and \\nSansa, and Jory and Hullen and Fat Tom and the rest, and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone, and \\nthey hadn\\'t come back either. And now Robb meant to go. Not to King\\'s Landing and not to swear \\nfealty, but to Riverrun, with a sword in his hand. And if their lord father were truly a prisoner, that could \\nmean his death for a certainty. It frightened Bran more than he could say. \\n\"If Robb has to go, watch over him,\" Bran entreated the old gods, as they watched him with the heart \\ntree\\'s red eyes, \"and watch over his men, Hal and Quent and the rest, and Lord Umber and Lady \\nMormont and the other lords. And Theon too, I suppose. Watch them and keep them safe, if it please \\nyou, gods. Help them defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home.\" \\nA faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and whispered. Summer bared his \\nteeth. \"You hear them, boy?\" a voice asked. \\nBran lifted his head. Osha stood across the pool, beneath an ancient oak, her face shadowed by leaves. \\nEven in irons, the wildling moved quiet as a cat. Summer circled the pool, sniffed at her. The tall woman \\nflinched. \\n\"Summer, to me,\" Bran called. The direwolf took one final sniff, spun, and bounded back. Bran \\nwrapped his arms around him. \"What are you doing here?\" He had not seen Osha since they\\'d taken her \\ncaptive in the wolfswood, though he knew she\\'d been set to working in the kitchens. \\n\"They are my gods too,\" Osha said. \"Beyond the Wall, they are the only gods.\" Her hair was growing \\nPage 386\\n\\nout, brown and shaggy. It made her look more womanly, that and the simple dress of brown roughspun \\nthey\\'d given her when they took her mail and leather. \"Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, \\nwhen I feel the need, and I let him do as he likes under my skirt, when he feels the need. It\\'s nothing to \\nme. I like the smell of flour on his hands, and he\\'s gentler than Stiv.\" She gave an awkward bow. \"I\\'ll \\nleave you. There\\'s pots that want scouring.\" \\n\"No, stay,\" Bran commanded her. \"Tell me what you meant, about hearing the gods.\" \\nOsha studied him. \"You asked them and they\\'re answering. Open your ears, listen, you\\'ll hear.\" \\nBran listened. \"It\\'s only the wind,\" he said after a moment, uncertain. \"The leaves are rustling.\" \\n\"Who do you think sends the wind, if not the gods?\" She seated herself across the pool from him, \\nclinking faintly as she moved. Mikken had fixed iron manacles to her ankles, with a heavy chain between \\nthem; she could walk, so long as she kept her strides small, but there was no way for her to run, or climb, \\nor mount a horse. \"They see you, boy. They hear you talking. That rustling, that\\'s them talking back.\" \\n:\\'What are they saying?\" \\n\\'They\\'re sad. Your lord brother will get no help from them, not where he\\'s going. The old gods have no \\npower in the south. The weirwoods there were all cut down, thousands of years ago. How can they \\nwatch your brother when they have no eyes?\" \\nBran had not thought of that. It frightened him. If even the gods could not help his brother, what hope \\nwas there? Maybe Osha wasn\\'t hearing them right. He cocked his head and tried to listen again. He \\nthought he could hear the sadness now, but nothing more than that. \\nThe rustling grew louder. Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming, and Hodor came blundering \\nout of the trees, naked and smiling. \"Hodor!\" \\n\"He must have heard our voices,\" Bran said. \"Hodor, you forgot your clothes.\" \\n\"Hodor,\" Hodor agreed. He was dripping wet from the neck down, steaming in the chill air. His body \\nwas covered with brown hair, thick as a pelt. Between his legs, his manhood swung long and heavy. \\nOsha eyed him with a sour smile. \"Now there\\'s a big man,\" she said. \"He has giant\\'s blood in him, or I\\'m \\nthe queen.\" \\n\"Maester Luwin says there are no more giants. He says they\\'re all dead, like the children of the forest. \\nAll that\\'s left of them are old bones in the earth that men turn up with plows from time to time.\" \\n\"Let Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall,\" Osha said. \"He\\'ll find giants then, or they\\'ll find him. My \\nbrother killed one. Ten foot tall she was, and stunted at that. They\\'ve been known to grow big as twelve \\nand thirteen feet. Fierce things they are too, all hair and teeth, and the wives have beards like their \\nhusbands, so there\\'s no telling them apart. The women take human men for lovers, and it\\'s from them the \\nhalf bloods come. It goes harder on the women they catch. The men are so big they\\'ll rip a maid apart \\nbefore they get her with child.\" She grinned at him. \"But you don\\'t know what I mean, do you, boy?\" \\n\"Yes I do,\" Bran insisted. He understood about mating; he had seen dogs in the yard, and watched a \\nPage 387\\n\\nstallion mount a mare. But talking about it made him uncomfortable. He looked at Hodor. \"Go back and \\nbring your clothes, Hodor,\" he said. \"Go dress.\" \\n\"Hodor.\" He walked back the way he had come, ducking under a low-hanging tree limb. \\nHe was awfully big, Bran thought as he watched him go. \"Are there truly giants beyond the Wall?\" he \\nasked Osha, uncertainly. \\n\"Giants and worse than giants, Lordling. I tried to tell your brother when he asked his questions, him and \\nyour maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy. The cold winds are rising, and men go out from their fires and \\nnever come back . . . or if they do, they\\'re not men no more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold \\nblack hands. Why do you think I run south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools? Mance thinks \\nhe\\'ll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were no more than rangers, but what \\ndoes he know? He can call himself King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes, but he\\'s still just another old black \\ncrow who flew down from the Shadow Tower. He\\'s never tasted winter. I was born up there, child, like \\nmy mother and her mother before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk. We remember.\" \\nOsha stood, her chains rattling together. \"I tried to tell your lordling brother. Only yesterday, when I saw \\nhim in the yard. \\'M\\'Iord Stark,\\' I called to him, respectful as you please, but he looked through me, and \\nthat sweaty oaf Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path. So be it. I\\'ll wear my irons and hold my \\ntongue. A man who won\\'t listen can\\'t hear.\" \\n\"Tell me. Robb will listen to me, I know he will.\" \\n\"Will he now? We\\'ll see. You tell him this, m1ord. You tell him he\\'s bound on marching the wrong way. \\nIt\\'s north he should be taking his swords. North, not south. You hear me?\" \\nBran nodded. \"I\\'ll tell him.\" \\nBut that night, when they feasted in the Great Hall, Robb was not with them. He took his meal in the \\nsolar instead, with Lord Rickard and the Greatjon and the other lords bannermen, to make the final plans \\nfor the long march to come. It was left to Bran to fill his place at the head of the table, and act the host to \\nLord Karstark\\'s sons and honored friends. They were already at their places when Hodor carried Bran \\ninto the hall on his back, and knelt beside the high seat. Two of the serving men helped lift him from his \\nbasket. Bran could feel the eyes of every stranger in the hall. It had grown quiet. \"My lords,\" Hallis \\nMollen announced, \"Brandon Stark, of Winterfell.\" \\n\"I welcome you to our fires,\" Bran said stiffly, \"and offer you meat and mead in honor of our friendship.\" \\nHarrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard\\'s sons, bowed, and his brothers after him, yet as they \\nsettled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. \\n11. . . sooner die than live like that,\" muttered one, his father\\'s namesake Eddard, and his brother \\nTorrhen said likely the boy was broken inside as well as out, too craven to take his own life. \\nBroken, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was now? Bran the Broken? \"I \\ndon\\'t want to be broken,\" he whispered fiercely to Maester Luwin, who\\'d been seated to his right. \"I \\nwant to be a knight.\" \\n\"There are some who call my order the knights of the mind,\" Luwin replied. \"You are a surpassing clever \\nboy when you work at it, Bran. Have you ever thought that you might wear a maester\\'s chain? There is \\nPage 388\\n\\nno limit to what you might learn.\" \\n\"I want to learn magic,\" Bran told him. \"The crow promised that I would fly.\" \\nMaester Luwin sighed. \"I can teach you history, healing, herblore. I can teach you the speech of ravens, \\nand how to build a castle, and the way a sailor steers his ship by the stars. I can teach you to measure the \\ndays and mark the seasons, and at the Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more. \\nBut, Bran, no man can teach you magic.\" \\n\"The children could,\" Bran said. \"The children of the forest.\" That reminded him of the promise he had \\nmade to Osha in the godswood, so he told Luwin what she had said. \\nThe maester listened politely. \"The wildling woman could give Old Nan lessons in telling tales, I think,\" \\nhe said when Bran was done. \"I will talk with her again if you like, but it would be best if you did not \\ntrouble your brother with this folly. He has more than enough to \\nconcern him without fretting over giants and dead men in the woods. It\\'s the Lannisters who hold your \\nlord father, Bran, not the children of the forest.\" He put a gentle hand on Bran\\'s arm. \"Think on what I \\nsaid, child.\" \\nAnd two days later, as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky, Bran found himself in the yard \\nbeneath the gatehouse, strapped atop Dancer as he said his farewells to his brother. \\n\"You are the lord in Winterfell now,\" Robb told him. He was mounted on a shaggy grey stallion, his \\nshield hung from the horse\\'s side; wood banded with iron, white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a \\ndirewolf. His brother wore grey chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagger at his waist, a \\nfur-trimmed cloak across his shoulders. \"You must take my place, as I took Father\\'s, until we come \\nhome.\" \\n\"I know,\" Bran replied miserably. He had never felt so little or alone or scared. He did not know how to \\nbe a lord. \\n\"Listen to Maester Luwin\\'s counsel, and take care of Rickon. Tell him that I\\'ll be back as soon as the \\nfighting is done.\" \\nRickon had refused to come down. He was up in his chamber, redeyed and defiant. \"No!\" he\\'d \\nscreamed when Bran had asked if he didn\\'t want to say farewell to Robb. \"NO farewell!\" \\n\"I told him,\" Bran said. \"He says no one ever comes back.\" \\n\"He can\\'t be a baby forever. He\\'s a Stark, and near four.\" Robb sighed. \"Well, Mother will be home \\nsoon. And I\\'ll bring back Father, I promise.\" \\nHe wheeled his courser around and trotted away. Grey Wind followed, loping beside the warhorse, lean \\nand swift. Hallis Mollen went before them through the gate, carrying the rippling white banner of House \\nStark atop a high standard of grey ash. Theon Greyjoy and the Greatjon fell in on either side of Robb, \\nand their knights formed up in a double column behind them, steel-tipped lances glinting in the sun. \\nUncomfortably, he remembered Osha\\'s words. He\\'s marching the wrong way, he thought. For an instant \\nPage 389\\n\\nhe wanted to gallop after him and shout a warning, but when Robb vanished beneath the portcullis, the \\nmoment was gone. \\nBeyond the castle walls, a roar of sound went up. The foot soldiers and townsfolk were cheering Robb \\nas he rode past, Bran knew; cheering for Lord Stark, for the Lord of Winterfell on his great stallion, with \\nhis cloak streaming and Grey Wind racing beside him. They would never cheer for him that way, he \\nrealized with a dull ache. He might be the lord in Winterfell while his brother and father were gone, but he \\nwas still Bran the Broken. He could not even get off his own horse, except to fall. \\nWhen the distant cheers had faded to silence and the yard was empty at last, Winterfell seemed deserted \\nand dead. Bran looked around at the faces of those who remained, women and children and old men . . . \\nand Hodor. The huge stableboy had a lost and frightened look to his face. \"Hodor?\" he said sadly. \\n\"Hodor,\" Bran agreed, wondering what it meant. \\nDAENERYS \\nWhen he had taken his pleasure, Khal Drogo rose from their sleeping mats to tower above her. His skin \\nshone dark as bronze in the ruddy light from the brazier, the faint lines of old scars visible on his broad \\nchest. Ink-black hair, loose and unbound, cascaded over his shoulders and down his back, well past his \\nwaist. His manhood glistened wetly. The khal\\'s mouth twisted in a frown beneath the droop of his long \\nmustachio. \"The stallion who mounts the world has no need of iron chairs.\" \\nDany propped herself on an elbow to look up at him, so tall and magnificent. She loved his hair \\nespecially. It had never been cut; he had never known defeat. \"It was prophesied that the stallion will ride \\nto the ends of the earth,\" she said. \\n\"The earth ends at the black salt sea,\" Drogo answered at once. He wet a cloth in a basin of warm water \\nto wipe the sweat and oil from his skin. \"No horse can cross the poison water.\" \\n\"In the Free Cities, there are ships by the thousand,\" Dany told him, as she had told him before. \\n\"Wooden horses with a hundred legs, that fly across the sea on wings full of wind.\" \\nKhal Drogo did not want to hear it. \"We will speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs.\" He \\ndropped the cloth and began to dress. \"This day I will go to the grass and hunt, woman wife,\" he \\nannounced as he shrugged into a painted vest and buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of \\nsilver, gold, and bronze. \\n\"Yes, my sun-and-stars,\" Dany said. Drogo would take his bloodriders and ride in search of hrakkar, \\nthe great white lion of the plains. If they returned triumphant, her lord husband\\'s joy would be fierce, and \\nhe might be willing to hear her out. \\nPage 390\\n\\nSavage beasts he did not fear, nor any man who had ever drawn breath, but the sea was a different \\nmatter. To the Dothraki, water that a horse could not drink was something foul; the heaving grey-green \\nplains of the ocean filled them with superstitious loathing. Drogo was a bolder man than the other \\nhorselords in half a hundred ways, she had found . . . but not in this. If only she could get him onto a ship \\n. . . \\nAfter the khal and his bloodriders had ridden off with their bows, Dany summoned her handmaids. Her \\nbody felt so fat and ungainly now that she welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands, \\nwhereas before she had often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her. They \\nscrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk, loose and flowing. As Doreah combed out her hair, she \\nsent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont. \\nThe knight came at once. He wore horsehair leggings and painted vest, like a rider. Coarse black hair \\ncovered his thick chest and muscular arms. \"My princess. How may I serve you?\" \\n\"You must talk to my lord husband,\" Dany said. \"Drogo says the stallion who mounts the world will have \\nall the lands of the earth to rule, and no need to cross the poison water. He talks of leading his khalasar \\neast after Rhaego is born, to plunder the lands around the Jade Sea.\" \\nThe knight looked thoughtful. \"The khal has never seen the Seven Kingdoms,\" he said. \"They are nothing \\nto him. If he thinks of them at all, no doubt he thinks of islands, a few small cities clinging to rocks in the \\nmanner of Lorath or Lys, surrounded by stormy seas. The riches of the east must seem a more tempting \\nprospect.\" \\n\"But he must ride west,\" Dany said, despairing. \"Please, help me make him understand.\" She had never \\nseen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet she felt as though she knew them from all the \\ntales her brother had told her. Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back \\none day, but he was dead now and his promises had died with him. \\n\"The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons,\" the knight answered. \"Have patience, \\nPrincess. Do not make your brother\\'s mistake. We will go home, I promise you.\" \\nHome? The word made her feel sad. Ser Jorah had his Bear Island, \\nbut what was home to her? A few tales, names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer, the fading \\nmemory of a red door ... was Vaes Dothrak to be her home forever? When she looked at the crones of \\nthe dosh khaleen, was she looking at her future? \\nSer Jorah must have seen the sadness on her face. \"A great caravan arrived during the night, Khaleesi. \\nFour hundred horses, from Pentos by way of Norvos and Qohor, under the command of Merchant \\nCaptain Byan Votyris. Illyrio may have sent a letter. Would you care to visit the Western Market?\" \\nDany stirred. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I would like that.\" The markets came alive when a caravan had come in. \\nYou could never tell what treasures the traders might bring this time, and it would be good to hear men \\nspeaking Valyrian again, as they did in the Free Cities. \"Irri, have them prepare a litter.,, \\n\"I shall tell your khas,\" Ser Jorah said, withdrawing. \\nPage 391\\n\\nIf Khal Drogo had been with her, Dany would have ridden her silver. Among the Dothraki, mothers \\nstayed on horseback almost up to the moment of birth, and she did not want to seem weak in her \\nhusband\\'s eyes. But with the khal off hunting, it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried \\nacross Vaes Dothrak, with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun. Ser Jorah saddled up and rode \\nbeside her, with the four young men of her khas and her handmaids. \\nThe day was warm and cloudless, the sky a deep blue. When the wind blew, she could smell the rich \\nscents of grass and earth. As her litter passed beneath the stolen monuments, she went from sunlight to \\nshadow and back again. Dany swayed along, studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings. She \\nwondered if the gods of burned cities could still answer prayers. \\nIf I were not the blood of the dragon, she thought wistfully, this could be my home. She was khaleesi, \\nshe had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve her, warriors to keep her safe, an honored \\nplace in the dosh khaleen awaiting her when she grew old . . . and in her womb grew a son who would \\none day bestride the world. That should be enough for any woman . . . but not for the dragon. With \\nViserys gone, Daenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and conquerors, and so too \\nthe child inside her. She must not forget. \\nThe Western Market was a great square of beaten earth surrounded by warrens of mud-baked brick, \\nanimal pens, whitewashed drinking halls. Hummocks rose from the ground like the backs of great \\nsubterranean beasts breaking the surface, yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous \\nstorerooms below. The interior of the \\nsquare was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles, shaded by awnings of woven grass. \\nA hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in stalls when they arrived, \\nyet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted compared to the teeming bazaars that Dany \\nremembered from Pentos and the other Free Cities. The caravans made their way to Vaes Dothrak from \\neast and west not so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other, Ser Jorah had explained. \\nThe riders let them come and go unmolested, so long as they observed the peace of the sacred city, did \\nnot profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the World, and honored the crones of the dosh \\nkhaleen with the traditional gifts of salt, silver, and seed. The Dothraki did not truly comprehend this \\nbusiness of buying and selling. \\nDany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too, with all its queer sights and sounds and smells. \\nShe often spent her mornings there, nibbling tree eggs, locust pie, and green noodles, listening to the high \\nululating voices of the spellsingers, gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and \\nthe striped black-and-white horses of the Jogos Nhai. She enjoyed watching all the people too: dark \\nsolemn Asshai\\'i and tall pale Qartheen, the bright-eyed men of Yi Ti in monkey-tail hats, warrior maids \\nfrom Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, and Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their \\ncheeks, even the dour and frightening Shadow Men, who covered their arms and legs and chests with \\ntattoos and hid their faces behind masks. The Eastern Market was a place of wonder and magic for \\nDany. \\nBut the Western Market smelled of home. \\nAs Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter, she sniffed, and recognized the sharp odors of garlic and \\npepper, scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond \\nsmile to her face. Under that she smelled the heady sweet perfumes of Lys. She saw slaves carrying bolts \\nPage 392\\n\\nof intricate Myrish lace and fine wools in a dozen rich colors. Caravan guards wandered among the aisles \\nin copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton, empty scabbards swinging from their \\nwoven leather belts. Behind one stall an armorer displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver \\nin ornate patterns, and helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts. Next to him was a pretty young \\nwoman selling Lannisport goldwork, rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely wrought medallions \\nsuitable for belting. A huge eunuch guarded her stall, mute and hairless, dressed in sweat-stained velvets \\nand scowling at anyone who came close. Across the aisle, a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was \\nhaggling with a Pentoshi over the price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and \\nforth as he shook his head. \\n\"When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,\" Dany told Ser Jorah as they wandered down the \\nshady aisle between the stalls. \"It was so alive there, all the people shouting and laughing, so many \\nwonderful things to look at . . . though we seldom had enough coin to buy anything . . . well, except for a \\nsausage now and again, or honeyfingers . . . do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the kind \\nthey bake in Tyrosh?\" \\n\"Cakes, are they? I could not say, Princess.\" The knight bowed. \"If you would pardon me for a time, I \\nwill seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us.\" \\n\"Very well. I\\'ll help you find him.\" \\n\"There is no need for you to trouble yourself.\" Ser Jorah glanced away impatiently. \"Enjoy the market. I \\nwill rejoin you when my business is concluded.\" \\nCutious, Dany thought as she watched him stride off through the throngs. She didn\\'t see why she should \\nnot go with him. Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a woman after he met with the merchant captain. \\nWhores frequently traveled with the caravans, she knew, and some men were queerly shy about their \\ncouplings. She gave a shrug. \"Come,\" she told the others. \\nHer handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed her stroll through the market. \"Oh, look,\" she exclaimed \\nto Doreah, \"those are the kind of sausages I meant.\" She pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman \\nwas grilling meat and onions on a hot firestone. \"They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers.\" \\nDelighted with her discovery, Dany insisted the others join her for a sausage. Her handmaids wolfed \\ntheirs down giggling and grinning, though the men of her khas sniffed at the grilled meat suspiciously. \\n\"They taste different than I remember,\" Dany said after her first few bites. \\n\"In Pentos, I make them with pork,\" the old woman said, \"but all my pigs died on the Dothraki sea. \\nThese are made of horsemeat, Khaleesi, but I spice them the same.\" \\n\"Oh.\" Dany felt disappointed, but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided to have another one, and \\nRakharo had to outdo him and eat three more, belching loudly. Dany giggled. \\n\"You have not laughed since your brother the Khal Rhaggat was crowned by Drogo,\" said Irri. \"It is \\ngood to see, Khaleesi.\" \\nDany smiled shyly. It was sweet to laugh. She felt half a girl again. \\nThey wandered for half the morning. She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from the Summer Isles, and \\nPage 393\\n\\ntook it for a gift. In return, she gave \\nthe merchant a silver medallion from her belt. That was how it was done among the Dothraki. A \\nbirdseller taught a green-and-red parrot to say her name, and Dany laughed again, yet still refused to take \\nhim. What would she do with a green-and-red parrot in a khalasar? She did take a dozen flasks of \\nscented oils, the perfumes of her childhood; she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could \\nsee the big house with the red door once more. When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility charm at a \\nmagician\\'s booth, Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid, thinking that now she should find \\nsomething for Irri and Jhiqui as well. \\nTurning a corner, they came upon a wine merchant offering thimble-sized cups of his wares to the \\npassersby. \"Sweet reds,\" he cried in fluent Dothraki, \"I have sweet reds, from Lys and Volantis and the \\nArbor. Whites from Lys, Tyroshi pear brandy, firewine, pepperwine, the pale green nectars of Myr. \\nSmokeberry browns and Andalish sours, I have them, I have them.\" He was a small man, slender and \\nhandsome, his flaxen hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of Lys. When Dany paused before his \\nstall, he bowed low. \"A taste for the khaleesi? I have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady, it sings of plums \\nand cherries and rich dark oak. A cask, a cup, a swallow? One taste, and you will name your child after \\nme.\" \\nDany smiled. \"My son has his name, but I will try your summerwine,\" she said in Valyrian, Valyrian as \\nthey spoke it in the Free Cities. The words felt strange on her tongue, after so long. \"Just a taste, if you \\nwould be so kind.\" \\nThe merchant must have taken her for Dothraki, with her clothes and her oiled hair and sun-browned \\nskin. When she spoke, he gaped at her in astonishment. \"My lady, you are . . . Tyroshi? Can it be so?\" \\n\"My speech may be Tyroshi, and my garb Dothraki, but I am of Westeros, of the Sunset Kingdoms,\" \\nDany told him. \\nDoreah stepped up beside her. \"You have the honor to address Daenerys of the House Targaryen, \\nDaenerys Stormborn, khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms.\" \\nThe wine merchant dropped to his knees. \"Princess,\" he said, bowing his head. \\n\"Rise,\" Dany commanded him. \"I would still like to taste that summerwine you spoke of.\" \\nThe man bounded to his feet. \"That? Dornish swill. It is not worthy of a princess. I have a dry red from \\nthe Arbor, crisp and delectable. Please, let me give you a cask.\" \\nKhal Drogo\\'s visits to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good \\nwine, and Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him. \"You honor me, ser,\" she murmured \\nsweetly. \\n\"The honor is mine.\" The merchant rummaged about in the back of his stall and produced a small oaken \\ncask. Burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes. \"The Redwyne sigil,\" he said, pointing, \"for the \\nArbor. There is no finer drink.\" \\nPage 394\\n\\n\"Khal Drogo and I will share it together. Aggo, take this back to my litter, if you\\'d be so kind.\" The \\nwineseller beamed as the Dothraki hefted the cask. \\nShe did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say, \"No. \" His voice was \\nstrange, brusque. \"Aggo, put down that cask.\" \\nAggo looked at Dany. She gave a hesitant nod. \"Ser Jorah, is something wrong?\" \\n\"I have a thirst. Open it, wineseller.\" \\nThe merchant frowned. \"The wine is for the khaleesi, not for the likes of you, ser.\" \\nSer Jorah moved closer to the stall. \"If you don\\'t open it, I\\'ll crack it open with your head.\" He carried \\nno weapons here in the sacred city, save his hands-yet his hands were enough, big, hard, dangerous, his \\nknuckles covered with coarse dark hairs. The wineseller hesitated a moment, then took up his hammer \\nand knocked the plug from the cask. \\n\"Pour,\" Ser Jorah commanded. The four young warriors of Dany\\'s khas arrayed themselves behind him, \\nfrowning, watching with their dark, almond-shaped eyes. \\n\"It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe.\" The wineseller had not put his \\nhammer down. \\nJhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt, but Dany stopped him with a light touch on the arm. \"Do \\nas Ser Jorah says,\" she said. People were stopping to watch. \\nThe man gave her a quick, sullen glance. \"As the princess commands.\" He had to set aside his hammer \\nto lift the cask. He filled two thimble-sized tasting cups, pouring so deftly he did not spill a drop. \\nSer Jorah lifted a cup and sniffed at the wine, frowning. \\n\"Sweet, isn\\'t it?\" the wineseller said, smiling. \"Can you smell the fruit, ser? The perfume of the Arbor. \\nTaste it, my lord, and tell me it isn\\'t the finest, richest wine that\\'s ever touched your tongue.\" \\nSer Jorah offered him the cup. \"You taste it first.\" \\n\"Me?\" The man laughed. \"I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord. And it\\'s a poor wine merchant who \\ndrinks up his own wares.\" His smile was amiable, yet she could see the sheen of sweat on his brow. \\n\"You will drink,\" Dany said, cold as ice. \"Empty the cup, or I will tell them to hold you down while Ser \\nJorah pours the whole cask down your throat.\" \\nThe wineseller shrugged, reached for the cup . . . and grabbed the cask instead, flinging it at her with \\nboth hands. Ser Jorah bulled into her, knocking her out of the way. The cask bounced off his shoulder \\nand smashed open on the ground. Dany stumbled and lost her feet. \"No, \" she screamed, thrusting her \\nhands out to break her fall . . . and Doreah caught her by the arm and wrenched her backward, so she \\nlanded on her legs and not her belly. \\nPage 395\\n\\nThe trader vaulted over the stall, darting between Aggo and Rakharo. Quaro reached for an arakh that \\nwas not there as the blond man slammed him aside. He raced down the aisle. Dany heard the snap of \\nJhogo\\'s whip, saw the leather lick out and coil around the wineseller\\'s leg. The man sprawled face first in \\nthe dirt. \\nA dozen caravan guards had come running. With them was the master himself, Merchant Captain Byan \\nVotyris, a diminutive Norvoshi with skin like old leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to \\nhis ears. He seemed to know what had happened without a word being spoken. \"Take this one away to \\nawait the pleasure of the khal,\" he commanded, gesturing at the man on the ground. Two guards hauled \\nthe wineseller to his feet. \"His goods I gift to you as well, Princess,\" the merchant captain went on. \"Small \\ntoken of regret, that one of mine would do this thing.\" \\nDoreah and Jhiqui helped Dany back to her feet. The poisoned wine was leaking from the broken cask \\ninto the dirt. \"How did you know?\" she asked Ser Jorah, trembling. \"How?\" \\n\"I did not know, Khaleesi, not until the man refused to drink, but once I read Magister Illyrio\\'s letter, I \\nfeared.\" His dark eyes swept over the faces of the strangers in the market. \"Come. Best not to talk of it \\nhere.\" \\nDany was near tears as they carried her back. The taste in her mouth was one she had known before: \\nfear. For years she had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of waking the dragon. This was even worse. It \\nwas not just for herself that she feared now, but for her baby. He must have sensed her fright, for he \\nmoved restlessly inside her. Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently, wishing she could reach him, \\ntouch him, soothe him. \"You are the blood of the dragon, little one,\" she whispered as her litter swayed \\nalong, curtains drawn tight. \"You are the blood of the dragon, and the dragon does not fear.\" \\nUnder the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak, Dany ordered them to leave \\nher-all but Ser Jorah. \"Tell \\nme,\" she commanded as she lowered herself onto her cushions. \"Was it the Usurper?\" \\n\"Yes.\" The knight drew out a folded parchment. \"A letter to Viserys, from Magister Illyrio. Robert \\nBaratheon offers lands and lordships for your death, or your brother\\'s.\" \\n\"My brother?\" Her sob was half a laugh. \"He does not know yet, does he? The Usurper owes Drogo a \\nlordship.\" This time her laugh was half a sob. She hugged herself protectively. \"And me, you said. Only \\nme?\" \\n\"You and the child,\" Ser Jorah said, grim. \\n\"No. He cannot have my son.\" She would not weep, she decided. She would not shiver with fear. The \\nUsurper has woken the dragon now, she told herself . . . and her eyes went to the dragon\\'s eggs resting \\nin their nest of dark velvet. The shifting lamplight linmed their stony scales, and shimmering motes of jade \\nand scarlet and gold swam in the air around them, like courtiers around a king. \\nWas it madness that seized her then, born of fear? Or some strange wisdom buried in her blood? Dany \\ncould not have said. She heard her own voice saying, \"Ser Jorah, light the brazier.\" \\n\"Khaleesi?\" The knight looked at her strangely. \"It is so hot. Are you certain?\" \\nPage 396\\n\\nShe had never been so certain. \"Yes. I . . . I have a chill. Light the brazier.\" \\nHe bowed. \"As you command.\" \\nWhen the coals were afire, Dany sent Ser Jorah from her. She had to be alone to do what she must do. \\nThis is madness, she told herself as she lifted the black-and-scarlet egg from the velvet. It will only crack \\nand bum, and it\\'s so beautiful, Ser Jorah will call me a fool if I ruin it, and yet, and yet . . . \\nCradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to the fire and pushed it down amongst the burning \\ncoals. The black scales seemed to glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked against the stone with small \\nred tongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one in the fire. As she stepped back from \\nthe brazier, the breath trembled in her throat. \\nShe watched until the coals had turned to ashes. Drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole. \\nHeat shimmered in waves around the dragon\\'s eggs. And that was all. \\nYour brother Rhaegar was the last dragon, Ser Jorah had said. Dany gazed at her eggs sadly. What had \\nshe expected? A thousand thousand years ago they had been alive, but now they were only pretty rocks. \\nThey could not make a dragon. A dragon was air and fire. Living flesh, not dead stone. \\nThe brazier was cold again by the time Khal Drogo returned. Cohollo was leading a packhorse behind \\nhim, with the carcass of a great white lion slung across its back. Above, the stars were coming out. The \\nkhal laughed as he swung down off his stallion and showed her the scars on his leg where the hrakkar \\nhad raked him through his leggings. \"I shall make you a cloak of its skin, moon of my life,\" he swore. \\nWhen Dany told him what had happened at the market, all laughter stopped, and Khal Drogo grew very \\nquiet. \\n\"This poisoner was the first,\" Ser Jorah Mormont warned him, \"but he will not be the last. Men will risk \\nmuch for a lordship.\" \\nDrogo was silent for a time. Finally he said, \"This seller of poisons ran from the moon of my life. Better \\nhe should run after her. So he will. Jhogo, Jorah the Andal, to each of you I say, choose any horse you \\nwish from my herds, and it is yours. Any horse save my red and the silver that was my bride gift to the \\nmoon of my life. I make this gift to you for what you did. \\n\"And to Rhaego son of Drogo, the stallion who will mount the world, to him I also pledge a gift. To him I \\nwill give this iron chair his mother\\'s father sat in. I will give him Seven Kingdoms. 1, Drogo, khal, will do \\nthis thing.\" His voice rose, and he lifted his fist to the sky. \"I will take my khalasar west to where the \\nworld ends, and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before. I will kill \\nthe men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses. I will rape their women, take their children as \\nslaves, and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of \\nMountains. This I vow, 1, Drogo son of Bharbo. This I swear before the Mother of Mountains, as the \\nstars look down in witness.\" \\nHis khalasar left Vaes Dothrak two days later, striking south and west across the plains. Khal Drogo led \\nthem on his great red stallion, with Daenerys beside him on her silver. The wineseller hurried behind them, \\nPage 397\\n\\nnaked, on foot, chained at throat and wrists. His chains were fastened to the halter of Dany\\'s silver. As \\nshe rode, he ran after her, barefoot and stumbling. No harm would come to him . . . so long as he kept \\nup. \\nCATELYN \\nIt was too far to make out the banners clearly, but even through the drifting fog she could see that they \\nwere white, with a dark \\nsmudge in their center that could only be the direwolf of Stark, grey upon its icy field. When she saw it \\nwith her own eyes, Catelyn reined up her horse and bowed her head in thanks. The gods were good. \\nShe was not too late. \\n\"They await our coming, my lady,\" Ser Wylis Manderly said, \"as my lord father swore they would.\" \\n\"Let us not keep them waiting any longer, ser.\" Ser Brynden Tully put the spurs to his horse and trotted \\nbriskly toward the banners. Catelyn rode beside him. \\nSer Wylis and his brother Ser Wendel followed, leading their levies, near fifteen hundred men: some \\ntwenty-odd knights and as many squires, two hundred mounted lances, swordsmen, and freeriders, and \\nthe rest foot, armed with spears, pikes and tridents. Lord Wyman had remained behind to see to the \\ndefenses of White Harbor. A man of near sixty years, he had grown too stout to sit a horse. \"If I had \\nthought to see war again in my lifetime, I should have eaten a few less eels,\" he\\'d told Catelyn when he \\nmet her ship, slapping his massive belly with both hands. His fingers were fat as sausages. \"My boys will \\nsee you safe to your son, though, have no fear.\" \\nHis \"boys\" were both older than Catelyn, and she might have \\nwished that they did not take after their father quite so closely. Ser Wylis was only a few eels short of \\nnot being able to mount his own horse; she pitied the poor animal. Ser Wendel, the younger boy, would \\nhave been the fattest man she\\'d ever known, had she only neglected to meet his father and brother. Wylis \\nwas quiet and formal, Wendel loud and boisterous; both had ostentatious walrus mustaches and heads as \\nbare as a baby\\'s bottom; neither seemed to own a single garment that was not spotted with food stains. \\nYet she liked them well enough; they had gotten her to Robb, as their father had vowed, and nothing else \\nmattered. \\nShe was pleased to see that her son had sent eyes out, even to the east. The Lannisters would come \\nfrom the south when they came, but it was good that Robb was being careful. My son is leading a host to \\nwar, she thought, still only half believing it. She was desperately afraid for him, and for Winterfell, yet she \\ncould not deny feeling a certain pride as well. A year ago he had been a boy. What was he now? she \\nwondered. \\nOutriders spied the Manderly banners-the white merman with trident in hand, rising from a blue-green \\nsea-and hailed them warmly. They were led to a spot of high ground dry enough for a camp. Ser Wylis \\ncalled a halt there, and remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended, while his \\nbrother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and her uncle to present their father\\'s respects to their liege lord. \\nPage 398\\n\\nThe ground under their horses\\' hooves was soft and wet. It fell away slowly beneath them as they rode \\npast smoky peat fires, lines of horses, and wagons heavy-laden with hardbread and salt beef. On a stony \\noutcrop of land higher than the surrounding country, they passed a lord\\'s pavilion with walls of heavy \\nsailcloth. Catelyn recognized the banner, the bull moose of the Hornwoods, brown on its dark orange \\nfield. \\nJust beyond, through the mists, she glimpsed the walls and towers of Moat Cailin . . . or what remained \\nof them. Immense blocks of black basalt, each as large as a crofter\\'s cottage, lay scattered and tumbled \\nlike a child\\'s wooden blocks, half-sunk in the soft boggy soil. Nothing else remained of a curtain wall that \\nhad once stood as high as Winterfell\\'s. The wooden keep was gone entirely, rotted away a thousand \\nyears past, with not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood. All that was left of the great \\nstronghold of the First Men were three towers . . . three where there had once been twenty, if the \\ntaletellers could be believed. \\nThe Gatehouse Tower looked sound enough, and even boasted a \\nA GAME, OF THRONLS 525 \\nfew feet of standing wall to either side of it. The Drunkard\\'s Tower, off in the bog where the south and \\nwest walls had once met, leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of wine into the gutter. And the tall, \\nslender Children\\'s Tower, where legend said the children of the forest had once called upon their \\nnameless gods to send the hammer of the waters, had lost half its crown. It looked as if some great beast \\nhad taken a bite out of the crenellations along the tower top, and spit the rubble across the bog. All three \\ntowers were green with moss. A tree was growing out between the stones on the north side of the \\nGatehouse Tower, its gnarled limbs festooned with ropy white blankets of ghostskin. \\n\"Gods have mercy,\" Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before them. \"This is Moat Cailin? \\nIt\\'s no more than a-\" \\n\"-death trap,\" Catelyn finished. \"I know how it looks, Uncle. I thought the same the first time I saw it, but \\nNed assured me that this ruin is more formidable than it seems. The three surviving towers command the \\ncauseway from all sides, and any enemy must pass between them. The bogs here are impenetrable, full of \\nquicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes. To assault any of the towers, an army would need to \\nwade through waist-deep black muck, cross a moat full of lizard-lions, and scale walls slimy with moss, \\nall the while exposing themselves to fire from archers in the other towers.\" She gave her uncle a grim \\nsmile. \"And when night falls, there are said to be ghosts, cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger for \\nsouthron blood.\" \\nSer Brynden chuckled. \"Remind me not to linger here. Last I looked, I was southron myself.\" \\nStandards had been raised atop all three towers. The Karstark sunburst hung from the Drunkard\\'s \\nTower, beneath the direwolf; on the Children\\'s Tower it was the Greatjon\\'s giant in shattered chains. But \\non the Gatehouse Tower, the Stark banner flew alone. That was where Robb had made his seat. Catelyn \\nmade for it, with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind her, their horses stepping slowly down the \\nlog-andplank road that had been laid across the green-and-black fields of mud. \\nShe found her son surrounded by his father\\'s lords bannermen, in a drafty hall with a peat fire smoking in \\na black hearth. He was seated at a massive stone table, a pile of maps and papers in front of him, talking \\nintently with Roose Bolton and the Greatjon. At first he did not notice her . . . but his wolf did. The great \\ngrey beast was lying near the fire, but when Catelyn entered he lifted his head, and his golden eyes met \\nhers. The lords fell silent one by one, and Robb looked up at the \\nPage 399\\n\\nsudden quiet and saw her. \"Mother?\" he said, his voice thick with emotion. \\nCatelyn wanted to run to him, to kiss his sweet brow, to wrap him in her arms and hold him so tightly \\nthat he would never come to harm . * . but here in front of his lords, she dared not. He was playing a \\nman\\'s part now, and she would not take that away from him. So she held herself at the far end of the \\nbasalt slab they were using for a table. The direwolf got to his feet and padded across the room to where \\nshe stood. It seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be. \"You\\'ve grown a beard,\" she said to Robb, while \\nGrey Wind sniffed her hand. \\nHe rubbed his stubbled jaw, suddenly awkward. \"Yes.\" His chin hairs were redder than the ones on his \\nhead. \\n\"I like it.\" Catelyn stroked the wolfs head, gently. \"It makes you look like my brother Edmure.\" Grey \\nWind nipped at her fingers, playful, and trotted back to his place by the fire. \\nSer Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to pay his respects, kneeling \\nbefore her and pressing his brow to her hand. \"Lady Catelyn,\" he said, \"you are fair as ever, a welcome \\nsight in troubled times.\" The Glovers followed, Galbart and Robett, and Greatjon Umber, and the rest, \\none by one. Theon Greyjoy was the last. \"I had not looked to see you here, my lady,\" he said as he knelt. \\n\"I had not thought to be here,\" Catelyn said, \"until I came ashore at White Harbor, and Lord Wyman \\ntold me that Robb had called the banners. You know his son, Ser Wendel.\" Wendel Manderly stepped \\nforward and bowed as low as his girth would allow. \"And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my \\nsister\\'s service for mine.\" \\n\"The Blackfish,\" Robb said. \"Thank you for joining us, ser. We need men of your courage. And you, Ser \\nWendel, I am glad to have you here. Is Ser Rodrik with you as well, Mother? I\\'ve missed him.\" \\n\"Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor. I have named him castellan and commanded him to \\nhold Winterfell till our return. Maester Luwin is a wise counsellor, but unskilled in the arts of war.\" \\n\"Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark,\" the Greatjon told her in his bass rumble. \"Winterfell is safe. \\nWe\\'ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister\\'s bunghole soon enough, begging your pardons, and then it\\'s \\non to the Red Keep to free Ned.\" \\n\"My lady, a question, as it please you.\" Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, had a small voice, yet \\nwhen he spoke larger men quieted to listen. His eyes were curiously pale, almost without color, and his \\nlook disturbing. \"It is said that you hold Lord Tywin\\'s dwarf son as captive. Have you brought him to us? \\nI vow, we should make good use of such a hostage.\" \\n\"I did hold Tyrion Lannister, but no longer,\" Catelyn was forced to admit. A chorus of consternation \\ngreeted the news. \"I was no more pleased than you, my lords. The gods saw fit to free him, with some \\nhelp from my fool of a sister.\" She ought not to be so open in her contempt, she knew, but her parting \\nfrom the Eyrie had not been pleasant. She had offered to take Lord Robert with her, to foster him at \\nWinterfell for a few years. The company of other boys would do him good, she had dared to suggest. \\nLysa\\'s rage had been frightening to behold. \"Sister or no,\" she had replied, \"if you try to steal my son, you \\nPage 400\\n\\nwill leave by the Moon Door.\" After that there was no more to be said. \\nThe lords were anxious to question her further, but Catelyn raised a hand. \"No doubt we will have time \\nfor all this later, but my journey has fatigued me. I would speak with my son alone. I know you will \\nforgive me, my lords.\" She gave them no choice; led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood, the \\nbannermen bowed and took their leave. \"And you, Theon,\" she added when Greyjoy lingered. He smiled \\nand left them. \\nThere was ale and cheese on the table. Catelyn tilled a horn, sat, sipped, and studied her son. He \\nseemed taller than when she\\'d left, and the wisps of beard did make him look older. \"Edmure was sixteen \\nwhen he grew his first whiskers.\" \\n\"I will be sixteen soon enough,\" Robb said. \\n\"And you are fifteen now. Fifteen, and leading a host to battle. Can you understand why I might fear, \\nRobb?\" \\nHis look grew stubborn. \"There was no one else.\" \\n\"No one?\" she said. \"Pray, who were those men I saw here a moment ago? Roose Bolton, Rickard \\nKarstark, Galbart and Robett Glover, the Greatjon, Heiman Tallhart . . . you might have given the \\ncommand to any of them. Gods be good, you might even have sent Theon, though he would not be my \\nchoice.\" \\n\"They are not Starks,\" he said. \\n\"They are men, Robb, seasoned in battle. You were fighting with wooden swords less than a year past.\" \\nShe saw anger in his eyes at that, but it was gone as quick as it came, and suddenly he was a boy again. \\n\"I know,\" he said, abashed. \"Are you . . . are you sending me back to Winterfell?\" \\nCatelyn sighed. \"I should. You ought never have left. Yet I dare not, not now. You have come too far. \\nSomeday these lords will look to you as their liege. If I pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed \\nwithout his supper, they will remember, and laugh about it in their cups. The day will come when you \\nneed them to respect you, even fear you a little. Laughter is poison to fear. I will not do that to you, much \\nas I might wish to keep you safe.\" \\n\"You have my thanks, Mother,\" he said, his relief obvious beneath the formality. \\nShe reached across his table and touched his hair. \"You are my firstborn, Robb. I have only to look at \\nyou to remember the day you came into the world, red-faced and squalling.\" \\nHe rose, clearly uncomfortable with her touch, and walked to the hearth. Grey Wind rubbed his head \\nagainst his leg. \"You know . . . about Father?\" \\n\"Yes.\" The reports of Robert\\'s sudden death and Ned\\'s fall had frightened Catelyn more than she could \\nsay, but she would not let her son see her fear. \"Lord Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor. \\nHave you had any word of your sisters?\" \\nPage 401\\n\\n\"There was a letter,\" Robb said, scratching his direwolf under the jaw. \"One for you as well, but it came \\nto Winterfell with mine.\" He went to the table, rummaged among some maps and papers, and returned \\nwith a crumpled parchment. \"This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bring yours.\" \\nSomething in Robb\\'s tone troubled her. She smoothed out the paper and read. Concern gave way to \\ndisbelief, then to anger, and lastly to fear. \"This is Cersei\\'s letter, not your sister\\'s,\" she said when she was \\ndone. \"The real message is in what Sansa does not say. All this about how kindly and gently the \\nLannisters are treating her . . . I know the sound of a threat, even whispered. They have Sansa hostage, \\nand they mean to keep her.\" \\n\"There\\'s no mention of Arya,\" Robb pointed out, miserable. \\n\"No.\" Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here. \\n\"I had hoped . . . if you still held the Imp, a trade of hostages . . .\" He took Sansa\\'s letter and crumpled it \\nin his fist, and she could tell from the way he did it that it was not the first time. \"Is there word from the \\nEyrie? I wrote to Aunt Lysa, asking help. Has she called Lord Arryn\\'s banners, do you know? Will the \\nknights of the Vale come join us?\" \\n\"Only one,\" she said, \"the best of them, my uncle . . . but Brynden Blackfish was a Tully first. My sister is \\nnot about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.\" \\nRobb took it hard. \"Mother, what are we going to do? I brought this whole army together, eighteen \\nthousand men, but I don\\'t . . . I\\'m not certain . . .\" He looked to her, his eyes shining, the proud young \\nlord melted away in an instant, and quick as that he was a child again, a fifteen-year-old boy looking to \\nhis mother for answers. \\nIt would not do. \\n\"What are you so afraid of, Robb?\" she asked gently. \\n\"I . . .\" He turned his head away, to hide the first tear. \"If we march ... even if we win ... the Lannisters \\nhold Sansa, and Father. They\\'ll kill them, won\\'t they?\" \\n\"They want us to think so.\" \\n\"You mean they\\'re lying?\" \\n\"I do not know, Robb. What I do know is that you have no choice. If you go to King\\'s Landing and \\nswear fealty, you will never be allowed to leave. If you turn your tail and retreat to Winterfell, your lords \\nwill lose all respect for you. Some may even go over to the Lannisters. Then the queen, with that much \\nless to fear, can do as she likes with her prisoners. Our best hope, our only true hope, is that you can \\ndefeat the foe in the field. If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the Kingslayer captive, why then a \\ntrade might very well be possible, but that is not the heart of it. So long as you have power enough that \\nthey must fear you, Ned and your sister should be safe. Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need \\nthem to make her peace, should the fighting go against her.\" \\n\"What if the fighting doesn\\'t go against her?\" Robb asked. \"What if it goes against us?\" \\nPage 402\\n\\nCatelyn took his hand. \"Robb, I will not soften the truth for you. If you lose, there is no hope for any of \\nus. They say there is naught but stone at the heart of Casterly Rock. Remember the fate of Rhaegar\\'s \\nchildren.\" \\nShe saw the fear in his young eyes then, but there was a strength as well. \"Then I will not lose,\" he \\nvowed. \\n\"Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands,\" she said. She had to learn if he was truly ready. \\n\"Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth,\" Robb said. \"Uncle \\nEdmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass, but the Kingslayer descended on them \\nand put them to flight. Lord Vance was slain. The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back \\nto join your brother and his other bannermen at Riverrun, with Jaime Lannister on his heels. That\\'s not the \\nworst of it, though. All the time they were battling in the pass, Lord Tywin was bringing a second \\nLannister army around from the south. It\\'s said to be even larger than Jaime\\'s host. \\n\"Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, under the king\\'s own \\nbanner. He gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but \\nSer Raymun Darry rode with him, and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of \\nFather\\'s own guardsmen. Only it was a \\ntrap. Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king\\'s \\nbanner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the \\nMummer\\'s Ford. This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser \\nRaymun was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell. Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, it\\'s \\nsaid, and now he\\'s marching north toward Harrenhal, burning as he goes.\" \\nGrim and grimmer, thought Catelyn. It was worse than she\\'d imagined. \"You mean to meet him here?\" \\nshe asked. \\n\"If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will,\" Robb said. \"I\\'ve sent word to Howland Reed, Father\\'s \\nold friend at Greywater Watch. If the Lannisters come up the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed them \\nevery step of the way, but Galbart Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton \\nagrees. He\\'ll stay close to the Trident, they believe, taking the castles of the river lords one by one, until \\nRiverrun stands alone. We need to march south to meet him.\" \\nThe very idea of it chilled Catelyn to the bone. What chance would a fifteen-year-old boy have against \\nseasoned battle commanders like Jaime and Tywin Lannister? \"Is that wise? You are strongly placed \\nhere. It\\'s said that the old Kings in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times \\nthe size of their own.\" \\n\"Yes, but our food and supplies are running low, and this is not land we can live off easily. We\\'ve been \\nwaiting for Lord Manderly, but now that his sons have joined us, we need to march.\" \\nShe was hearing the lords bannermen speaking with her son\\'s voice, she realized. Over the years, she \\nhad hosted many of them at Winterfell, and been welcomed with Ned to their own hearths and tables. \\nShe knew what sorts of men they were, each one. She wondered if Robb did. \\nAnd yet there was sense in what they said. This host her son had assembled was not a standing army \\nPage 403\\n\\nsuch as the Free Cities were accustomed to maintain, nor a force of guardsmen paid in coin. Most of \\nthem were smallfolk: crofters, fieldhands, fishermen, sheepherders, the sons of innkeeps and traders and \\ntanners, leavened with a smattering of sellswords and freeriders hungry for plunder. When their lords \\ncalled, they came . . . but not forever. \"Marching is all very well,\" she said to her son, \"but where, and to \\nwhat purpose? What do you mean to do?\" \\nRobb hesitated. \"The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin and surprise him,\" he \\nsaid, \"but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we\\'d be wiser to go around his army and join up with Uncle \\nSer Edmure against the Kingslayer.\" He ran his fingers through \\nhis shaggy mane of auburn hair, looking unhappy. \"Though by the time we reach Riverrun ... I\\'m not \\ncertain . . .\" \\n\"Be certain,\" Catelyn told her son, \"or go home and take up that wooden sword again. You cannot \\nafford to seem indecisive in front of men like Roose Bolton and Rickard Karstark. Make no mistake, \\nRobb-these are your bannermen, not your friends. You named yourself battle commander. Command.\" \\nHer son looked at her, startled, as if he could not credit what he was hearing. \"As you say, Mother.\" \\n\"I\\'ll ask you again. What do you mean to do?\" \\nRobb drew a map across the table, a ragged piece of old leather covered with lines of faded paint. One \\nend curled up from being rolled; he weighed it down with his dagger. \"Both plans have virtues, but . . . \\nlook, if we try to swing around Lord Tywin\\'s host, we take the risk of being caught between him and the \\nl(ingslayer, and if we attack him . . . by all reports, he has more men than I do, and a lot more armored \\nhorse. The Greatjon says that won\\'t matter if we catch him with his breeches down, but it seems to me \\nthat a man who has fought as many battles as Tywin Lannister won\\'t be so easily surprised.\" \\n\"Good,\" she said. She could hear echoes of Ned in his voice, as he sat there, puzzling over the map. \\n\"Tell me more.\" \\n\"I\\'d leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin, archers mostly, and march the rest down the \\ncauseway,\" he said, \"but once we\\'re below the Neck, I\\'d split our host in two. The foot can continue \\ndown the kingsroad, while our horsemen cross the Green Fork at the Twins.\" He pointed. \"When Lord \\nTywin gets word that we\\'ve come south, he\\'ll march north to engage our main host, leaving our riders free \\nto hurry down the west bank to Riverrun.\" Robb sat back, not quite daring to smile, but pleased with \\nhimself and hungry for her praise. \\nCatelyn frowned down at the map. \"You\\'d put a river between the two parts of your army.\" \\n\"And between Jaime and Lord Tywin,\" he said eagerly. The smile came at last. \"There\\'s no crossing on \\nthe Green Fork above the ruby ford, where Robert won his crown. Not until the Twins, all the way up \\nhere, and Lord Frey controls that bridge. He\\'s your father\\'s bannerman, isn\\'t that so?\" \\nThe Late Lord Frey, Catelyn thought. \"He is,\" she admitted, \"but my father has never trusted him. Nor \\nshould you.\" \\n\"I won\\'t,\" Robb promised. \"What do you think?\" \\nPage 404\\n\\nShe was impressed despite herself. He looks like a Tully, she thought, yet he\\'s still his father\\'s son, and \\nNed taught him well. \"Which force would you command?\" \\n\"The horse,\" he answered at once. Again like his father; Ned would always take the more dangerous \\ntask himself. \\n\"And the other?\" \\n\"The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin. I thought I\\'d give him the honor.\" \\nIt was his first misstep, but how to make him see it without wounding his fledgling confidence? \"Your \\nfather once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as any man he had ever known.\" \\nRobb grinned. \"Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and he laughed about it. So you agree, then?\" \\n\"Your father is not fearless,\" Catelyn pointed out. \"He is brave, but that is very different.\" \\nHer son considered that for a moment. \"The eastern host will be all that stands between Lord Tywin and \\nWinterfell,\" he said thoughtfully. \"Well, them and whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat. So I \\ndon\\'t want someone fearless, do IT\\' \\n\"No. You want cold cunning, I should think, not courage.\" \\n\"Roose Bolton,\" Robb said at once. \"That man scares me.\" \\n\"Then let us pray he will scare Tywin Lannister as well.\" \\nRobb nodded and rolled up the map. \"I\\'ll give the commands, and assemble an escort to take you home \\nto Winterfell.\" \\nCatelyn had fought to keep herself strong, for Ned\\'s sake and for this stubborn brave son of theirs. She \\nhad put despair and fear aside, as if they were garments she did not choose to wear . . . but now she saw \\nthat she had donned them after all. \\n\"I am not going to Winterfell,\" she heard herself say, surprised at the sudden rush of tears that blurred \\nher vision. \"My father may be dying behind the walls of Riverrun. My brother is surrounded by foes. I \\nmust go to them.\" \\nTYRION \\nChella daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears had gone ahead to scout, and it was she who brought back \\nword of the army at the crossroads. \"By their fires I call them twenty thousand strong,\" she said. \"Their \\nbanners are red, with a golden lion.\" \\n\"Your father?\" Bronn asked. \\n\"Or my brother Jaime,\" Tyrion said. \"We shall know soon enough.\" He surveyed his ragged band of \\nPage 405\\n\\nbrigands: near three hundred Stone Crows, Moon Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men, and those just \\nthe seed of the army he hoped to grow. Gunthor son of Gurn was raising the other clans even now. He \\nwondered what his lord father would make of them in their skins and bits of stolen steel. If truth be told, \\nhe did not know what to make of them himself. Was he their commander or their captive? Most of the \\ntime, it seemed to be a little of both. \"It might be best if I rode down alone,\" he suggested. \\n\"Best for Tyrion son of Tywin,\" said Ulf, who spoke for the Moon Brothers. \\nShagga glowered, a fearsome sight to see. \"Shagga son of Dolf likes this not. Shagga will go with the \\nboyman, and if the boyman lies, Shagga will chop off his manhood-\" \\n,,-and feed it to the goats, yes,\" Tyrion said wearily. \"Shagga, I give you my word as a Lannister, I will \\nreturn.\" \\n\"Why should we trust your word?\" Chella was a small hard woman, \\nflat as a boy, and no fool. \"Lowland lords have lied to the clans before.\" \\n\"You wound me, Chella,\" Tyrion said. \"Here I thought we had become such friends. But as you will. \\nYou shall ride with me, and Shagga and Conn for the Stone Crows, Ulf for the Moon Brothers, and \\nTimett son of Timett for the Burned Men.\" The clansmen exchanged wary looks as he named them. \"The \\nrest shall wait here until I send for you. Try not to kill and maim each other while I\\'m gone.\" \\nHe put his heels to his horse and trotted off, giving them no choice but to follow or be left behind. Either \\nwas fine with him, so long as they did not sit down to talk for a day and a night. That was the trouble with \\nthe clans; they had an absurd notion that every man\\'s voice should be heard in council, so they argued \\nabout everything, endlessly. Even their women were allowed to speak. Small wonder that it had been \\nhundreds of years since they last threatened the Vale with anything beyond an occasional raid. Tyrion \\nmeant to change that. \\nBrorm rode with him. Behind them-after a quick bit of grumbling-the five clansmen followed on their \\nundersize garrons, scrawny things that looked like ponies and scrambled up rock walls like goats. \\nThe Stone Crows rode together, and Chella and Ulf stayed close as well, as the Moon Brothers and \\nBlack Ears had strong bonds between them. Timett son of Timett rode alone. Every clan in the \\nMountains of the Moon feared the Burned Men, who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage \\nand (the others said) roasted babies at their feasts. And even the other Burned Men feared Timett, who \\nhad put out his own left eye with a white-hot knife when he reached the age of manhood. Tyrion gathered \\nthat it was more customary for a boy to burn off a nipple, a finger, or (if he was truly brave, or truly mad) \\nan ear. Timett\\'s fellow Burned Men were so awed by his choice of an eye that they promptly named him \\na red hand, which seemed to be some sort of a war chief. \\n\"I wonder what their king burned off,\" Tyrion said to Bronn when he heard the tale. Grinning, the \\nsellsword had tugged at his crotch . . . but even Brorm kept a respectful tongue around Timett. If a man \\nwas mad enough to put out his own eye, he was unlikely to be gentle to his enemies. \\nDistant watchers peered down from towers of unmortared stone as the party descended through the \\nfoothills, and once Tyrion saw a raven take wing. Where the high road twisted between two rocky \\noutcrops, they came to the first strong point. A low earthen wall four feet high closed off the road, and a \\nPage 406\\n\\ndozen crossbowmen manned the heights. \\nA GAME OF TFIRONES 535 \\nTyrion halted his followers out of range and rode to the wall alone. \"Who commands here?\" he shouted \\nup. \\nThe captain was quick to appear, and even quicker to give them an escort when he recognized his lord\\'s \\nson. They trotted past blackened fields and burned holdfasts, down to the riverlands and the Green Fork \\nof the Trident. Tyrion saw no bodies, but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows; there had been \\nfighting here, and recently. \\nHalf a league from the crossroads, a barricade of sharpened stakes had been erected, manned by \\npikemen and archers. Behind the line, the camp spread out to the far distance. Thin fingers of smoke rose \\nfrom hundreds of cookfires, mailed men sat under trees and honed their blades, and familiar banners \\nfluttered from staffs thrust into the muddy ground. \\nA party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge them as they approached the stakes. The \\nknight who led them wore silver armor inlaid with amethysts and a striped purple-and-silver cloak. His \\nshield bore a unicorn sigil, and a spiral horn two feet long jutted up from the brow of his horsehead helm. \\nTyrion reined up to greet him. \"Ser Flement.\" \\nSer Flement Brax lifted his visor. \"Tyrion,\" he said in astonishment. \"My lord, we all feared you dead, or \\n. . .\" He looked at the clansmen uncertainly. \"These . . . companions of yours . . .\" \\n\"Bosom friends and loyal retainers,\" Tyrion said. \"Where will I find my lord father?\" \\n\"He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters.\" \\nTyrion laughed. The inn at the crossroads! Perhaps the gods were just after all. \"I will see him at once.\" \\n\"As you say, my lord.\" Ser Flement wheeled his horse about and shouted commands. Three rows of \\nstakes were pulled from the ground to make a hole in the line. Tyrion led his party through. \\nLord Tywin\\'s camp spread over leagues. Chella\\'s estimate of twenty thousand men could not be far \\nwrong. The common men camped out in the open, but the knights had thrown up tents, and some of the \\nhigh lords had erected pavilions as large as houses. Tyrion spied the red ox of the Presters, Lord \\nCrakehall\\'s brindled boar, the burning tree of Marbrand, the badger of Lydden. Knights called out to him \\nas he cantered past, and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment. \\nShagga was gaping back; beyond a certainty, he had never seen so many men, horses, and weapons in \\nall his days. The rest of the mountain brigands did a better job of guarding their faces, but Tyrion had no \\ndoubts that they were full as much in awe. Better and better. The more \\nimpressed they were with the power of the Lannisters, the easier they would be to command. \\nThe inn and its stables were much as he remembered, though little more than tumbled stones and \\nblackened foundations remained where the rest of the village had stood. A gibbet had been erected in the \\nyard, and the body that swung there was covered with ravens. At Tyrion\\'s approach they took to the air, \\nPage 407\\n\\nsquawking and flapping their black wings. He dismounted and glanced up at what remained of the \\ncorpse. The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks, baring her stained red teeth in a \\nhideous smile. \"A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was all I asked,\" he reminded her with a sigh \\nof reproach. \\nBoys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to their horses. Shagga did not want to give his up. \"The \\nlad won\\'t steal your mare,\" Tyrion assured him. \"He only wants to give her some oats and water and \\nbrush out her coat.\" Shagga\\'s coat could have used a good brushing too, but it would have been less than \\ntactful to mention it. \"You have my word, the horse will not be harmed.\" \\nGlaring, Shagga let go his grip on the reins. \"This is the horse of Shagga son of Dolf,\" he roared at the \\nstableboy. \\n\"If he doesn\\'t give her back, chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats,\" Tyrion promised. \"Provided \\nyou can find some.\" \\nA pair of house guards in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms stood under the inn\\'s sign, on either side \\nof the door. Tyrion recognized their captain. \"My father?\" \\n\"In the common room, m\\'lord.\" \\n\"My men will want meat and mead,\" Tyrion told him. \"See that they get it.\" He entered the inn, and there \\nwas Father. \\nTywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, was in his middle fifties, yet hard as a \\nman of twenty. Even seated, he was tall, with long legs, broad shoulders, a flat stomach. His thin arms \\nwere corded with muscle. When his once-thick golden hair had begun to recede, he had commanded his \\nbarber to shave his head; Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures. He razored his lip and chin as \\nwell, but kept his side-whiskers, two great thickets of wiry golden hair that covered most of his cheeks \\nfrom ear to jaw. His eyes were a pale green, flecked with gold. A fool more foolish than most had once \\njested that even Lord Tywin\\'s shit was flecked with gold. Some said the man was still alive, deep in the \\nbowels of Casterly Rock. \\nSer Kevan Lannister, his father\\'s only surviving brother, was sharing a flagon of ale with Lord Tywin \\nwhen Tyrion entered the common room. His uncle was portly and balding, with a close-cropped yellow \\nbeard that followed the line of his massive jaw. Ser Kevan saw him first. \"Tyrion,\" he said in surprise. \\n\"Uncle,\" Tyrion said, bowing. \"And my lord father. What a pleasure to find you here.\" \\nLord Tywin did not stir from his chair, but he did give his dwarf son a long, searching look. \"I see that \\nthe rumors of your demise were unfounded.\" \\n\"Sorry to disappoint you, Father,\" Tyrion said. \"No need to leap up and embrace me, I wouldn\\'t want \\nyou to strain yourself.\" He crossed the room to their table, acutely conscious of the way his stunted legs \\nmade him waddle with every step. Whenever his father\\'s eyes were on him, he became uncomfortably \\naware of all his deformities and shortcomings. \"Kind of you to go to war for me,\" he said as he climbed \\ninto a chair and helped himself to a cup of his father\\'s ale. \\nPage 408\\n\\n\"By my lights, it was you who started this,\" Lord Tywin replied. \"Your brother Jaime would never have \\nmeekly submitted to capture at the hands of a woman.\" \\n\"That\\'s one way we differ, Jaime and 1. He\\'s taller as well, you may have noticed.\" \\nHis father ignored the sally. \"The honor of our House was at stake. I had no choice but to ride. No man \\nsheds Lannister blood with impunity.,, \\n\"Hear Me Roar, \" Tyrion said, grinning. The Lannister words. \"Truth be told, none of my blood was \\nactually shed, although it was a close thing once or twice. Morrec and Jyck were killed.\" \\n\"I suppose you will be wanting some new men.\" \\n\"Don\\'t trouble yourself, Father, I\\'ve acquired a few of my own.\" He tried a swallow of the ale. It was \\nbrown and yeasty, so thick you could almost chew it. Very fine, in truth. A pity his father had hanged the \\ninnkeep. \"How is your war going?\" \\nHis uncle answered. \"Well enough, for the nonce. Ser Edmure had scattered small troops of men along \\nhis borders to stop our raiding, and your lord father and I were able to destroy most of them piecemeal \\nbefore they could regroup.\" \\n\"Your brother has been covering himself with glory,\" his father said. \"He smashed the Lords Vance and \\nPiper at the Golden Tooth, and met the massed power of the Tullys under the walls of Riverrun. The \\nlords of the Trident have been put to rout. Ser Edmure Tully was taken captive, with many of his knights \\nand bannermen. Lord Blackwood led a few survivors back to Riverrun, where Jaime has them under \\nsiege. The rest fled to their own strongholds.\" \\n\"Your father and I have been marching on each in turn,\" Ser Kevan \\nsaid. \"With Lord Blackwood gone, Raventree fell at once, and Lady Whent yielded Harrenhal for want \\nof men to defend it. Ser Gregor burnt out the Pipers and the Brackens . . .\" \\n\"Leaving you unopposed?\" Tyrion said. \\n\"Not wholly,\" Ser Kevan said. \"The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder Frey is marshaling his levies \\nat the Twins.\" \\n\"No matter,\" Lord Tywin said. \"Frey only takes the field when the scent of victory is in the air, and all he \\nsmells now is ruin. And Jason Mallister lacks the strength to fight alone. Once Jaime takes Riverrun, they \\nwill both be quick enough to bend the knee. Unless the Starks and the Arryns come forth to oppose us, \\nthis war is good as won.\" \\n\"I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you,\" Tyrion said. \"The Starks are another matter. \\nLord Eddard-\" \\n\"-is our hostage,\" his father said. \"He will lead no armies while he rots in a dungeon under the Red \\nKeep.\" \\n\"No,\" Ser Kevan agreed, \"but his son has called the banners and sits at Moat Cailin with a strong host \\nPage 409\\n\\naround him.\" \\n\"No sword is strong until it\\'s been tempered,\" Lord Tywin declared. \"The Stark boy is a child. No doubt \\nhe likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the \\nend it comes down to butcher\\'s work. I doubt he has the stomach for it.\" \\nThings had gotten interesting while he\\'d been away, Tyrion reflected. \"And what is our fearless monarch \\ndoing whilst all this \\'butcher\\'s work\\' is being done?\" he wondered. \"How has my lovely and persuasive \\nsister gotten Robert to agree to the imprisonment of his dear friend Ned?\" \\n\"Robert Baratheon is dead,\" his father told him. \"Your nephew reigns in King\\'s Landing.\" \\nThat did take Tyrion aback. \"My sister, you mean.\" He took another gulp of ale. The realm would be a \\nmuch different place with Cersei ruling in place of her husband. \\n\"If you have a mind to make yourself of use, I will give you a command,\" his father said. \"Marq Piper \\nand Karyl Vance are loose in our rear, raiding our lands across the Red Fork.\" \\nTyrion made a tsking sound. \"The gall of them, fighting back. Ordinarily I\\'d be glad to punish such \\nrudeness, Father, but the truth is, I have pressing business elsewhere.\" \\n\"Do you?\" Lord Tywin did not seem awed. \"We also have a pair of Ned Stark\\'s afterthoughts making a \\nnuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging parties. Beric Dondarrion, some young lordling with \\ndelusions of valor. He has that fat jape of a priest with him, the one \\nwho likes to set his sword on fire. Do you think you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off? \\nWithout making too much a botch of it?\" \\nTyrion wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and smiled. \"Father, it warms my heart to think that \\nyou might entrust me with . . . what, twenty men? Fifty? Are you sure you can spare so many? Well, no \\nmatter. If I should come across Thoros and Lord Beric, I shall spank them both.\" He climbed down from \\nhis chair and waddled to the sideboard, where a wheel of veined white cheese sat surrounded by fruit. \\n\"First, though, I have some promises of my own to keep,\" he said as he sliced off a wedge. \"I shall \\nrequire three thousand helms and as many hauberks, plus swords, pikes, steel spearheads, maces, \\nbattleaxes, gauntlets, gorgets, greaves, breastplates, wagons to carry all this-\" \\nThe door behind him opened with a crash, so violently that Tyrion almost dropped his cheese. Ser \\nKevan leapt up swearing as the captain of the guard went flying across the room to smash against the \\nhearth. As he tumbled down into the cold ashes, his lion helm askew, Shagga snapped the man\\'s sword \\nin two over a knee thick as a tree trunk, threw down the pieces, and lumbered into the common room. \\nHe was preceded by his stench, riper than the cheese and overpowering in the closed space. \"Little \\nredcape,\" he snarled, \"when next you bare steel on Shagga son of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and \\nroast it in the fire.\" \\n\"What, no goats?\" Tyrion said, taking a bite of cheese. \\nThe other clansmen followed Shagga into the common room, Bronn with them. The sellsword gave \\nTyrion a rueful shrug. \\nPage 410\\n\\n\"Who might you be?\" Lord Tywin asked, cool as snow. \\n\"They followed me home, Father,\" Tyrion explained. \"May I keep them? They don\\'t eat much.\" \\nNo one was smiling. \"By what right do you savages intrude on our councils?\" demanded Ser Kevan. \\n\"Savages, lowlander?\" Conn might have been handsome if you washed him. \"We are free men, and free \\nmen by rights sit on all war councils.\" \\n\"Which one is the lion lord?\" Chella asked. \\n\"They are both old men,\" announced Timett son of Timett, who had yet to see his twentieth year. \\nSer Kevan\\'s hand went to his sword hilt, but his brother placed two fingers on his wrist and held him \\nfast. Lord Tywin seemed unperturbed. \"Tyrion, have you forgotten your courtesies? Kindly acquaint us \\nwith our . . . honored guests.\" \\nTyrion licked his fingers. \"With pleasure,\" he said. \"The fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk of the \\nBlack Ears.\" \\n\"I\\'m no maid,\" Chella protested. \"My sons have taken fifty ears among them.\" \\n\"May they take fifty more.\" Tyrion waddled away from her. \"This is Conn son of Coratt. Shagga son of \\nDolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair. They are Stone Crows. Here is Ulf son of Umar \\nof the Moon Brothers, and here Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn, \\na sellsword of no particular allegiance. He has already changed sides twice in the short time I\\'ve known \\nhim, you and he ought to get on famously, Father.\" To Bronn and the clansmen he said, \"May I present \\nmy lord father, Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, \\nShield of Lannisport, and once and future Hand of the King.\" \\nLord Tywin rose, dignified and correct. \"Even in the west, we know the prowess of the warrior clans of \\nthe Mountains of the Moon. What brings you down from your strongholds, my lords?\" \\n\"Horses,\" said Shagga. \\n\"A promise of silk and steel,\" said Timett son of Timett. \\nTyrion was about to tell his lord father how he proposed to reduce the Vale of Arryn to a smoking \\nwasteland, but he was never given the chance. The door banged open again. The messenger gave \\nTyrion\\'s clansmen a quick, queer look as he dropped to one knee before Lord Tywin. \"My lord,\" he \\nsaid, \"Ser Addam bid me tell you that the Stark host is moving down the causeway.\" \\nLord Tywin Lannister did not smile. Lord Tywin never smiled, but Tyrion had learned to read his father\\'s \\npleasure all the same, and it was there on his face. \"So the wolfling is leaving his den to play among the \\nlions,\" he said in a voice of quiet satisfaction. \"Splendid. Return to Ser Addam and tell him to fall back. \\nHe is not to engage the northerners until we arrive, but I want him to harass their flanks and draw them \\nfarther south.\" \\n\"It will be as you command.\" The rider took his leave. \\nPage 411\\n\\n\"We are well situated here,\" Ser Kevan pointed out. \"Close to the ford and ringed by pits and spikes. If \\nthey are coming south, I say let them come, and break themselves against us.\" \\n\"The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers,\" Lord Tywin replied. \"The \\nsooner the Starks are broken, the sooner I shall be free to deal with Stannis Baratheon. Tell the \\ndrummers to beat assembly, and send word to Jaime that I am marching against Robb Stark.\" \\n\"As you will,\" Ser Kevan said. \\nTyrion watched with a grim fascination as his lord father turned next to the half-wild clansmen. \"It is said \\nthat the men of the mountain clans are warriors without fear.\" \\n\"It is said truly,\" Conn of the Stone Crows answered. \\n\"And the women,\" Chella added. \\n\"Ride with me against my enemies, and you shall have all my son promised you, and more,\" Lord Tywin \\ntold them. \\n\"Would you pay us with our own coin?\" Ulf son of Umar said. \"Why should we need the father\\'s \\npromise, when we have the son\\'s?\" \\n\"I said nothing of need,\" Lord Tywin replied. \"My words were courtesy, nothing more. You need not \\njoin us. The men of the winterlands are made of iron and ice, and even my boldest knights fear to face \\nthem.\" \\nOh, deftly done, Tyrion thought, smiling crookedly. \\n\"The Burned Men fear nothing. Timett son of Timett will ride with the lions.\" \\n\"Wherever the Burned Men go, the Stone Crows have been there first,\" Conn declared hotly. \"We ride \\nas well.\" \\n\"Shagga son of Dolf will chop off their manhoods and feed them to the crows.\" \\n\"We will ride with you, lion lord,\" Chella daughter of Cheyk agreed, \"but only if your halfman son goes \\nwith us. He has bought his breath with promises. Until we hold the steel he has pledged us, his life is \\nours.\" \\nLord Tywin turned his gold-flecked eyes on his son. \\n\"Joy,\" Tyrion said with a resigned smile. \\nSANSA \\nThe walls of the throne room had been stripped bare, the hunting tapestries that King Robert loved \\nPage 412\\n\\ntaken down and stacked in the corner in an untidy heap. \\nSer Mandon Moore went to take his place under the throne beside two of his fellows of the Kingsguard. \\nSansa hovered by the door, for once unguarded. The queen had given her freedom of the castle as a \\nreward for being good, yet even so, she was escorted everywhere she went. \"Honor guards for my \\ndaughter-to-be,\" the queen called them, but they did not make Sansa feel honored. \\n\"Freedom, of the castle\" meant that she could go wherever she chose within the Red Keep so long as \\nshe promised not to go beyond the walls, a promise Sansa had been more than willing to give. She \\ncouldn\\'t have gone beyond the walls anyway. The gates were watched day and night by Janos Slynt\\'s \\ngold cloaks, and Lannister house guards were always about as well. Besides, even if she could leave the \\ncastle, where would she go? It was enough that she could walk in the yard, pick flowers in Myrcella\\'s \\ngarden, and visit the sept to pray for her father. Sometimes she prayed in the godswood as well, since the \\nStarks kept the old gods. \\nThis was the first court session of Joffrey\\'s reign, so Sansa looked about nervously. A line of Lannister \\nhouse guards stood beneath the western windows, a line of gold-cloaked City Watchmen beneath the \\neast. Of smallfolk and commoners, she saw no sign, but under the gallery a cluster of lords great and \\nsmall milled restlessly. There were no more than twenty, where a hundred had been accustomed to wait \\nupon King Robert. \\nSansa slipped in among them, murmuring greetings as she worked her way toward the front. She \\nrecognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho, gloomy Ser Aron Santagar, the Redwyne twins Horror and \\nSlobber . . . only none of them seemed to recognize her. Or if they did, they shied away as if she had the \\ngrey plague. Sickly Lord Gyles covered his face at her approach and feigned a fit of coughing, and when \\nfunny drunken Ser Dontos started to hail her, Ser Balon Swann whispered in his ear and he turned away. \\nAnd so many others were missing. Where had the rest of them gone? Sansa wondered. Vainly, she \\nsearched for friendly faces. Not one of them would meet her eyes. It was as if she had become a ghost, \\ndead before her time. \\nGrand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, seemingly asleep, his hands clasped \\ntogether atop his beard. She saw Lord Varys hurry into the hall, his feet making no sound. A moment \\nlater Lord Baelish entered through the tall doors in the rear, smiling. He chatted amiably with Ser Balon \\nand Ser Dontos as he made his way to the front. Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa\\'s stomach. I \\nshouldn\\'t be afraid, she told herself. I have nothing to be afraid of, it will all come out well, Joff loves me \\nand the queen does too, she said so. \\nA herald\\'s voice rang out. \"All hail His Grace, Joffrey of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister, the First \\nof his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. All \\nhail his lady mother, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent, Light of the West, and Protector of the \\nRealm.\" \\nSer Barristan Selmy, resplendent in white plate, led them in. Ser Arys Oakheart escorted the queen, \\nwhile Ser Boros Blount walked beside Joffrey, so six of the Kingsguard were now in the hall, all the \\nWhite Swords save Jaime Lannister alone. Her prince-no, her king now!-took the steps of the Iron \\nThrone two at a time, while his mother was seated with the council. Joff wore plush black velvets slashed \\nwith crimson, a shimmering cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar, and on his head a golden crown crusted \\nPage 413\\n\\nwith rubies and black diamonds. \\nWhen Joffrey turned to look out over the hall, his eye caught Sansa\\'s. He smiled, seated himself, and \\nspoke. \"It is a king\\'s duty to punish the disloyal and reward those who are true. Grand Maester Pycelle, I \\ncommand you to read my decrees.\" \\nPycelle pushed himself to his feet. He was clad in a magnificent robe of thick red velvet, with an ermine \\ncollar and shiny gold fastenings. From a drooping sleeve, heavy with gilded scrollwork, he drew a \\nparchment, unrolled it, and began to read a long list of names, commanding each in the name of king and \\ncouncil to present themselves and swear their fealty to Joffrey. Failing that, they would be adjudged \\ntraitors, their lands and titles forfeit to the throne. \\nThe names he read made Sansa hold her breath. Lord Stannis Baratheon, his lady wife, his daughter. \\nLord Renly Baratheon. Both Lord Royces and their sons. Ser Loras Tyrell. Lord Mace Tyrell, his \\nbrothers, uncles, sons. The red priest, Thoros of Myr. Lord Beric Dondarrion. Lady Lysa Arryn and her \\nson, the little Lord Robert. Lord Hoster Tully, his brother Ser Brynden, his son Ser Edmure. Lord Jason \\nMallister. Lord Bryce Caron of the Marches. Lord Tytos Blackwood. Lord Walder Frey and his heir \\nSer Stevron. Lord Karyl Vance. Lord Jonos Bracken. Lady Sheila Whent. Doran Martell, Prince of \\nDorne, and all his sons. So many, she thought as Pycelle read on and on, it will take a whole flock of \\nravens to send out these commands. \\nAnd at the end, near last, came the names Sansa had been dreading. Lady Catelyn Stark. Robb Stark. \\nBrandon Stark, Rickon Stark, Arya Stark. Sansa stifled a gasp. Arya. They wanted Arya to present \\nherself and swear an oath . . . it must mean her sister had fled on the galley, she must be safe at Winterfell \\nby now . . . \\nGrand Maester Pycelle rolled up the list, tucked it up his left sleeve, and pulled another parchment from \\nhis right. He cleared his throat and resumed. \"In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark, it is the wish of His \\nGrace that Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, take up the office of Hand \\nof the King, to speak with his voice, lead his armies against his enemies, and carry out his royal will. So \\nthe king has decreed. The small council consents. \\n\"In the place of the traitor Stannis Baratheon, it is the wish of His Grace that his lady mother, the Queen \\nRegent Cersei Lannister, who has ever been his staunchest support, be seated upon his small council, that \\nshe may help him rule wisely and with justice. So the king has decreed. The small council consents.\" \\nSansa heard a soft murmuring from the lords around her, but it was quickly stilled. Pycelle continued. \\n\"It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant, Janos Slynt, Commander of the City Watch of \\nKing\\'s Landing, be at once raised to the rank of lord and granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal with all its \\nattendant lands and incomes, and that his sons and grandsons shall hold these honors after him until the \\nend of time. It is moreover his \\ncommand that Lord Slynt be seated immediately upon his small council, to assist in the governance of the \\nrealm. So the king has decreed. The small council consents.\" \\nSansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his entrance. This time the \\nPage 414\\n\\nmuttering was louder and angrier. Proud lords whose houses went back thousands of years made way \\nreluctantly for the balding, frog-faced commoner as he marched past. Golden scales had been sewn onto \\nthe black velvet of his doublet and rang together softly with each step. His cloak was checked \\nblack-andgold satin. Two ugly boys who must have been his sons went before him, struggling with the \\nweight of a heavy metal shield as tall as they were. For his sigil he had taken a bloody spear, gold on a \\nnight-black field. The sight of it raised goose prickles up and down Sansa\\'s arms. \\nAs Lord Slynt took his place, Grand Maester Pycelle resumed. \"Lastly, in these times of treason and \\nturmoil, with our beloved Robert so lately dead, it is the view of the council that the life and safety of \\nKing Joffrey is of paramount importance He looked to the queen. \\nCersei stood. \"Ser Barristan Selmy, stand forth.\" \\nSer Barristan had been standing at the foot of the Iron Throne, as still as any statue, but now he went to \\none knee and bowed his head. \"Your Grace, I am yours to command.\" \\n\"Rise, Ser Barristan,\" Cersei Lannister said. \"You may remove your helm.\" \\n\"My lady?\" Standing, the old knight took off his high white helm, though he did not seem to understand \\nwhy. \\n\"You have served the realm long and faithfully, good ser, and every man and woman in the Seven \\nKingdoms owes you thanks. Yet now I fear your service is at an end. It is the wish of king and council \\nthat you lay down your heavy burden.\" \\n\"My . . . burden? I fear I . . . I do not \\nThe new-made lord, Janos Slynt, spoke up, his voice heavy and blunt. \"Her Grace is trying to tell you \\nthat you are relieved as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.\" \\nThe tall, white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there, scarcely breathing. \"Your Grace,\" he \\nsaid at last. \"The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood. Our vows are taken for life. Only death may \\nrelieve the Lord Commander of his sacred trust.\" \\n\"Whose death, Ser Barristan?\" The queen\\'s voice was soft as silk, but her words carried the whole \\nlength of the hall. \"Yours, or your king\\'s?\" \\n\"You let my father die,\" Joffrey said accusingly from atop the Iron Throne. \"You\\'re too old to protect \\nanybody.\" \\nSansa watched as the knight peered up at his new king. She had never seen him look his years before, \\nyet now he did. \"Your Grace,\" he said. \"I was chosen for the White Swords in my twenty-third year. It \\nwas all I had ever dreamed, from the moment I first took sword in hand. I gave up all claim to my \\nancestral keep. The girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place, I had no need of land or sons, my \\nlife would be lived for the realm. Ser Gerold Hightower himself heard my vows . . . to ward the king with \\nall my strength . . . to give my blood for his . . . I fought beside the White Bull and Prince Lewyn of \\nDorne . . . beside Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Before I served your father, I helped \\nshield King Aerys, and his father Jaehaerys before him . . . three kings . . .\" \\nPage 415\\n\\n\"And all of them dead,\" Littlefinger pointed out. \\n\"Your time is done,\" Cersei Lannister announced. \"Joffrey requires men around him who are young and \\nstrong. The council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as the Lord Commander \\nof Sworn Brothers of the White Swords.\" \\n\"The Kingslayer,\" Ser Barristan said, his voice hard with contempt. \"The false knight who profaned his \\nblade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend.\" \\n\"Have a care for your words, ser,\" the queen warned. \"You are speaking of our beloved brother, your \\nking\\'s own blood.\" \\nLord Varys spoke, gentler than the others. \"We are not unmindful of your service, good ser. Lord Tywin \\nLannister has generously agreed to grant you a handsome tract of land north of Lannisport, beside the \\nsea, with gold and men sufficient to build you a stout keep, and servants to see to your every need.\" \\nSer Barristan looked up sharply. \"A hall to die in, and men to bury me. I thank you, my lords . . . but I \\nspit upon your pity.\" He reached up and undid the clasps that held his cloak in place, and the heavy white \\ngarment slithered from his shoulders to fall in a heap on the floor. His helmet dropped with a clang. \"I am \\na knight,\" he told them. He opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well. \"I shall \\ndie a knight.\" \\n\"A naked knight, it would seem,\" quipped Littlefinger. \\nThey all laughed then, Joffrey on his throne, and the lords standing attendance, Janos Slynt and Queen \\nCersei and Sandor Clegane and even the other men of the Kingsguard, the five who had been his \\nbrothers until a moment ago. Surely that must have hurt the most, Sansa \\nthought. Her heart went out to the gallant old man as he stood shamed and red-faced, too angry to \\nspeak. Finally he drew his sword. \\nSansa heard someone gasp. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn moved forward to confront him, but Ser \\nBarristan froze them in place with a look that dripped contempt. \"Have no fear, sers, your king is safe . . . \\nno thanks to you. Even now, I could cut through the five of you as easy as a dagger cuts cheese. If you \\nwould serve under the Kingslayer, not a one of you is fit to wear the white.\" He flung his sword at the \\nfoot of the Iron Throne. \"Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the others, if you like. It will do you more \\ngood than the swords in the hands of these five. Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he \\ntakes your throne.\" \\nHe took the long way out, his steps ringing loud against the floor and echoing off the bare stone walls. \\nLords and ladies parted to let him pass. Not until the pages had closed the great oak-and-bronze doors \\nbehind him did Sansa hear sounds again: soft voices, uneasy stirrings, the shuffle of papers from the \\ncouncil table. \"He called me boy,\" Joffrey said peevishly, sounding younger than his years. \"He talked \\nabout my uncle Stannis too.\" \\n\"Idle talk,\" said Varys the eunuch. \"Without meaning \\n\"He could be making plots with my uncles. I want him seized and questioned.\" No one moved. Joffrey \\nraised his voice. \"I said, I want him seized!\" \\nPage 416\\n\\nJanos Slynt rose from the council table. \"My gold cloaks will see to it, Your Grace.\" \\n\"Good,\" said King Joffrey. Lord Janos strode from the hall, his ugly sons double-stepping to keep up as \\nthey lugged the great metal shield with the arms of House Slynt. \\n\"Your Grace,\" Littlefinger reminded the king. \"If we might resume, the seven are now six. We find \\nourselves in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard.\" \\nJoffrey smiled. \"Tell them, Mother.\" \\n\"The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is more fit to guard and \\nprotect His Grace than his sworn shield, Sandor Clegane.\" \\n\"How do you like that, dog?\" King Joffrey asked. \\nThe Hound\\'s scarred face was hard to read. He took a long moment to consider. \"Why not? I have no \\nlands nor wife to forsake, and who\\'d care if I did?\" The burned side of his mouth twisted. \"But I warn \\nyou, I\\'ll say no knight\\'s vows.\" \\n\"The Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard have always been knights,\" Ser Boros said firmly. \\n\"Until now,\" the Hound said in his deep rasp, and Ser Boros fell silent. \\nWhen the king\\'s herald moved forward, Sansa realized the moment was almost at hand. She smoothed \\ndown the cloth of her skirt nervously. She was dressed in mourning, as a sign of respect for the dead \\nking, but she had taken special care to make herself beautiful. Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen \\nhad given her, the one Arya had ruined, but she\\'d had them dye it black and you couldn\\'t see the stain at \\nall. She had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain \\nsilver chain. \\nThe herald\\'s voice boomed out. \"If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace, let him \\nspeak now or go forth and hold his silence.\" \\nSansa quailed. Now, she told herself, I must do it now. Gods give me courage. She took one step, then \\nanother. Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her pass, and she felt the weight of their eyes on \\nher. I must be as strong as my lady mother. \"Your Grace,\" she called out in a soft, tremulous voice. \\nThe height of the Iron Throne gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall. He was the \\nfirst to see her. \"Come forward, my lady,\" he called out, smiling. \\nHis smile emboldened her, made her feel beautiful and strong. He does love me, he does. Sansa lifted \\nher head and walked toward him, not too slow and not too fast. She must not let them see how nervous \\nshe was. \\n\"The Lady Sansa, of House Stark,\" the herald cried. \\nShe stopped under the throne, at the spot where Ser Barristan\\'s white cloak lay puddled on the floor \\nbeside his helm and breastplate. \"Do you have some business for king and council, Sansa?\" the queen \\nPage 417\\n\\nasked from the council table. \\n\"I do.\" She knelt on the cloak, so as not to spoil her gown, and looked up at her prince on his fearsome \\nblack throne. \"As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was the \\nHand of the King.\" She had practiced the words a hundred times. \\nThe queen sighed. \"Sansa, you disappoint me. What did I tell you about traitor\\'s blood?\" \\n\"Your father has committed grave and terrible crimes, my lady,\" Grand Maester Pycelle intoned. \\n\"Ah, poor sad thing,\" sighed Varys. \"She is only a babe, my lords, she does not know what she asks.\" \\nSansa had eyes only for Joffrey. He must listen to me, he must, she \\nthought. The king shifted on his seat, \"Let her speak,\" he commanded. \"I want to hear what she says.\" \\n\"Thank you, Your Grace.\" Sansa smiled, a shy secret smile, just for him. He was listening. She knew he \\nwould. \\n\"Treason is a noxious weed,\" Pycelle declared solemnly. \"It must be torn up, root and stem and seed, \\nlest new traitors sprout from every roadside.\" \\n\"Do you deny your father\\'s crime?\" Lord Baelish asked. \\n\"No, my lords.\" Sansa knew better than that. \"I know he must be punished. All I ask is mercy. I know \\nmy lord father must regret what he did. He was King Robert\\'s friend and he loved him, you all know he \\nloved him. He never wanted to be Hand until the king asked him. They must have lied to him. Lord Renly \\nor Lord Stannis or . . . or somebody, they must have lied, otherwise . . .\" \\nKing Joffrey leaned forward, hands grasping the arms of the throne. Broken sword points fanned out \\nbetween his fingers. \"He said I wasn\\'t the king. Why did he say that?\" \\n\"His leg was broken,\" Sansa replied eagerly. \"It hurt ever so much, Maester Pycelle was giving him milk \\nof the poppy, and they say that milk of the poppy fills your head with clouds. Otherwise he would never \\nhave said it.\" \\nVarys said, \"A child\\'s-faith . . . such sweet innocence . . . and yet, they say wisdom oft comes from the \\nmouths of babes.\" \\n\"Treason is treason,\" Pycelle replied at once. \\nJoffrey rocked restlessly on the throne. \"Mother?\" \\nCersei Lannister considered Sansa thoughtfully. \"If Lord Eddard were to confess his crime,\" she said at \\nlast, \"we would know he had repented his folly.\" \\nJoffrey pushed himself to his feet. Please, Sansa thought, please, please, be the king I know you are, \\ngood and kind and noble, please. \"Do you have any more to say?\" he asked her. \\nPage 418\\n\\n\"Only . . . that as you love me, you do me this kindness, my prince,\" Sansa said. \\nKing Joffrey looked her up and down. \"Your sweet words have moved me,\" he said gallantly, nodding, \\nas if to say all would be well. \"I shall do as you ask . . . but first your father has to confess. He has to \\nconfess and say that I\\'m the king, or there will be no mercy for him.\" \\n\"He will,\" Sansa said, heart soaring. \"Oh, I know he will.\" \\nEDDARD \\nThe straw on the floor stank of urine. There was no window, no bed, not even a slop bucket. He \\nremembered walls of pale red stone festooned with patches of nitre, a grey door of splintered wood, four \\ninches thick and studded with iron. He had seen them, briefly, a quick glimpse as they shoved him inside. \\nOnce the door had slammed shut, he had seen no more. The dark was absolute. He had as well been \\nblind. \\nOr dead. Buried with his king. \"Ah, Robert,\" he murmured as his groping hand touched a cold stone \\nwall, his leg throbbing with every motion. He remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of \\nWinterfell, as the Kings of Winter looked on with cold stone eyes. The king eats, Robert had said, and \\nthe Hand takes the shit. How he had laughed. Yet he had gotten it wrong. The king dies, Ned Stark \\nthought, and the Hand is buried. \\nThe dungeon was under the Red Keep, deeper than he dared imagine. He remembered the old stories \\nabout Maegor the Cruel, who murdered all the masons who labored on his castle, so they might never \\nreveal its secrets. \\nHe damned them all: Littlefinger, Janos Slynt and his gold cloaks, the queen, the Kingslayer, Pycelle and \\nVarys and Ser Barristan, even Lord Renly, Robert\\'s own blood, who had run when he was needed \\nmost. Yet in the end he blamed himself. \"Fool, \" he cried to the darkness, \"thrice-damned blind fool.\" \\nCersei Lannister\\'s face seemed to float before him in the darkness. Her hair was full of sunlight, but there \\nwas mockery in her smile. \"When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die,\" she whispered. \\nNed had played and lost, and his men had paid the price of his folly with their life\\'s blood. \\nWhen he thought of his daughters, he would have wept gladly, but the tears would not come. Even now, \\nhe was a Stark of Winterfell, and his grief and his rage froze hard inside him. \\nWhen he kept very still, his leg did not hurt so much, so he did his best to lie unmoving. For how long he \\ncould not say. There was no sun and no moon. He could not see to mark the walls. Ned closed his eyes \\nand opened them; it made no difference. He slept and woke and slept again. He did not know which was \\nmore painful, the waking or the sleeping. When he slept, he dreamed: dark disturbing dreams of blood \\nand broken promises. When he woke, there was nothing to do but think, and his waking thoughts were \\nworse than nightmares. The thought of Cat was as painful as a bed of nettles. He wondered where she \\nwas, what she was doing. He wondered whether he would ever see her again. \\nHours turned to days, or so it seemed. He could feel a dull ache in his shattered leg, an itch beneath the \\nPage 419\\n\\nplaster. When he touched his thigh, the flesh was hot to his fingers. The only sound was his breathing. \\nAfter a time, he began to talk aloud, just to hear a voice. He made plans to keep himself sane, built \\ncastles of hope in the dark. Robert\\'s brothers were out in the world, raising armies at Dragonstone and \\nStorm\\'s End. Alyn and Harwin would return to King\\'s Landing with the rest of his household guard once \\nthey had dealt with Ser Gregor. Catelyn would raise the north when the word reached her, and the lords \\nof river and mountain and Vale would join her. \\nHe found himself thinking of Robert more and more. He saw the king as he had been in the flower of his \\nyouth, tall and handsome, his great antlered helm on his head, his warhammer in hand, sitting his horse \\nlike a horned god. He heard his laughter in the dark, saw his eyes, blue and clear as mountain lakes. \\n\"Look at us, Ned,\" Robert said. \"Gods, how did we come to this? You here, and me killed by a pig. We \\nwon a throne together . . .\" \\nIfailed you, Robert, Ned thought. He could not say the words. I lied to you, hid the truth. I let them kill \\nyou. \\nThe king heard him. \"You stiff-necked fool,\" he muttered, \"too proud to listen. Can you eat pride, Stark? \\nWill honor shield your \\nchildren?\" Cracks ran down his face, fissures opening in the flesh, and he reached up and ripped the \\nmask away. It was not Robert at all; it was Littlefinger, grinning, mocking him. When he opened his \\nmouth to speak, his lies turned to pale grey moths and took wing. \\nNed was half-asleep when the footsteps came down the hall. At first he thought he dreamt them; it had \\nbeen so long since he had heard anything but the sound of his own voice. Ned was feverish by then, his \\nleg a dull agony, his lips parched and cracked. When the heavy wooden door creaked open, the sudden \\nlight was painful to his eyes. \\nA gaoler thrust a jug at him. The clay was cool and beaded with moisture. Ned grasped it with both \\nhands and gulped eagerly. Water ran from his mouth and dripped down through his beard. He drank until \\nhe thought he would be sick. \"How long . . . T\\' he asked weakly when he could drink no more. \\nThe gaoler was a scarecrow of a man with a rat\\'s face and frayed beard, clad in a mail shirt and a leather \\nhalf cape. \"No talking,\" he said as he wrenched the jug from Ned\\'s hands. \\n\"Please,\" Ned said, \"my daughters . . .\" The door crashed shut. He blinked as the light vanished, lowered \\nhis head to his chest, and curled up on the straw. It no longer stank of urine and shit. It no longer smelled \\nat all. \\nHe could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping. The memory came creeping upon \\nhim in the darkness, as vivid as a dream. It was the year of false spring, and he was eighteen again, down \\nfrom the Eyrie to the tourney at Harrenhal. He could see the deep green of the grass, and smell the pollen \\non the wind. Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine. He remembered Brandon\\'s \\nlaughter, and Robert\\'s berserk valor in the melee, the way he laughed as he unhorsed men left and right. \\nHe remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of \\nthe king\\'s pavilion and making his vows to protect and defend King Aerys. Afterward, Ser Oswell Whent \\nhelped Jaime to his feet, and the White Bull himself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold Hightower, fastened \\nthe snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about his shoulders. All six White Swords were there to welcome \\ntheir newest brother. \\nPage 420\\n\\nYet when the jousting began, the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen. The crown prince wore the armor \\nhe would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the \\nbreast. A plume of scarlet silk streamed behind him when he rode, and it seemed no lance could touch \\nhim. Brandon fell to him, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword \\nof the Morning. \\nRobert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser \\nBarristan in the final tilt to claim the champion\\'s crown. Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles \\ndied, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia \\nMartell, to lay the queen of beauty\\'s laurel in Lyanna\\'s lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, \\nblue as frost. \\nNed Stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown, but beneath the pale blue petals the thorns \\nlay hidden. He felt them clawing at his skin, sharp and cruel, saw the slow trickle of blood run down his \\nfingers, and woke, trembling, in the dark. \\nPromise me, Ned, his sister had whispered from her bed of blood. She had loved the scent of winter \\nroses. \\n\"Gods save me,\" Ned wept. \"I am going mad.\" \\nThe gods did not deign to answer. \\nEach time the turnkey brought him water, he told himself another day had passed. At first he would beg \\nthe man for some word of his daughters and the world beyond his cell. Grunts and kicks were his only \\nreplies. Later, when the stomach cramps began, he begged for food instead. It made no matter; he was \\nnot fed. Perhaps the Lannisters meant for him to starve to death. \"No,\" he told himself. If Cersei had \\nwanted him dead, he would have been cut down in the throne room with his men. She wanted him alive. \\nWeak, desperate, yet alive. Catelyn held her brother; she dare not kill him or the Imp\\'s life would be \\nforfeit as well. \\nFrom outside his cell came the rattle of iron chains. As the door creaked open, Ned put a hand to the \\ndamp wall and pushed himself toward the light. The glare of a torch made him squint. \"Food,\" he \\ncroaked. \\n\"Wine,\" a voice answered. It was not the rat-faced man; this gaoler was stouter, shorter, though he wore \\nthe same leather half cape and spiked steel cap. \"Drink, Lord Eddard.\" He thrust a wineskin into Ned\\'s \\nhands. \\nThe voice was strangely familiar, yet it took Ned Stark a moment to place it. \"Varys?\" he said groggily \\nwhen it came. He touched the man\\'s face. \"I\\'m not . . . not dreaming this. You\\'re here.\" The eunuch\\'s \\nplump cheeks were covered with a dark stubble of beard. Ned felt the coarse hair with his fingers. Varys \\nhad transformed himself into a grizzled turnkey, reeking of sweat and sour wine. \"How did you . . . what \\nsort of magician are you?\" \\n\"A thirsty one,\" Varys said. \"Drink, my lord.\" \\nPage 421\\n\\nNed\\'s hands fumbled at the skin. \"Is this the same poison they gave Robert?\" \\n\"You wrong me,\" Varys said sadly. \"Truly, no one loves a eunuch. Give me the skin.\" He drank, a trickle \\nof red leaking from the corner of his plump mouth. \"Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night \\nof the tourney, but no more poisonous than most,\" he concluded, wiping his lips. \"Here.\" \\nNed tried a swallow. \"Dregs.\" He felt as though he were about to bring the wine back up. \\n\"All men must swallow the sour with the sweet. High lords and eunuchs alike. Your hour has come, my \\nlord.\" \\n\"My daughters . . .\" \\n\"The younger girl escaped Ser Meryn and fled,\" Varys told him. \"I have not been able to find her. Nor \\nhave the Lannisters. A kindness, there. Our new king loves her not. Your older girl is still betrothed to \\nJoffrey. Cersei keeps her close. She came to court a few days ago to plead that you be spared. A pity \\nyou couldn\\'t have been there, you would have been touched.\" He leaned forward intently. \"I trust you \\nrealize that you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?\" \\n\"The queen will not kill me,\" Ned said. His head swam; the wine was strong, and it had been too long \\nsince he\\'d eaten. \"Cat . . . Cat holds her brother . . .\" \\n\"The wrong brother,\" Varys sighed. \"And lost to her, in any case. She let the Imp slip through her \\nfingers. I expect he is dead by now, somewhere in the Mountains of the Moon.\" \\n\"If that is true, slit my throat and have done with it.\" He was dizzy from the wine, tired and heartsick. \\n\"Your blood is the last thing I desire.\" \\nNed frowned. \"When they slaughtered my guard, you stood beside the queen and watched, and said not \\na word.\" \\n\"And would again. I seem to recall that I was unarmed, unarmored, and surrounded by Lannister \\nswords.\" The eunuch looked at him curiously, tilting his head. \"When I was a young boy, before I was \\ncut, I traveled with a troupe of mummers through the Free Cities. They taught me that each man has a \\nrole to play, in life as well as mummery. So it is at court. The King\\'s Justice must be fearsome, the master \\nof coin must be frugal, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be valiant . . . and the master of \\nwhisperers must be sly and obsequious and without scruple. A courageous informer would be as useless \\nas a cowardly knight.\" He took the wineskin back and drank. \\nNed studied the eunuch\\'s face, searching for truth beneath the \\nmummer\\'s scars and false stubble. He tried some more wine. This time it went down easier. \"Can you \\nfree me from this pit?\" \\n\"I could . . . but will I? No. Questions would be asked, and the answers would lead back to me.\" \\nNed had expected no more. \"You are blunt.\" \\nPage 422\\n\\n\"A eunuch has no honor, and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples, my lord.\" \\n\"Would you at least consent to carry a message out for me?\" \\n\"That would depend on the message. I will gladly provide you with paper and ink, if you like. And when \\nyou have written what you will, I will take the letter and read it, and deliver it or not, as best serves my \\nown ends.\" \\n\"Your own ends. What ends are those, Lord Varys?\" \\n\"Peace,\" Varys replied without hesitation. \"If there was one soul in King\\'s Landing who was truly \\ndesperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me.\" He sighed. \"For fifteen years I protected him from \\nhis enemies, but I could not protect him from his friends. What strange fit of madness led you to tell the \\nqueen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey\\'s birth?\" \\n\"The madness of mercy,\" Ned admitted. \\n\"Ah,\" said Varys. \"To be sure. You are an honest and honorable man, Lord Eddard. Ofttimes I forget \\nthat. I have met so few of them in my life.\" He glanced around the cell. \"When I see what honesty and \\nhonor have won you, I understand why.\" \\nNed Stark laid his head back against the damp stone wall and closed his eyes. His leg was throbbing. \\n\"The king\\'s wine . . . did you question Lancel?\" \\n\"Oh, indeed. Cersei gave him the wineskins, and told him it was Robert\\'s favorite vintage.\" The eunuch \\nshrugged. \"A hunter lives a perilous life. If the boar had not done for Robert, it would have been a fall \\nfrom a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astray . . . the forest is the abbatoir of the gods. It \\nwas not wine that killed the king. It was your mercy.\" \\nNed had feared as much. \"Gods forgive me.\" \\n\"If there are gods,\" Varys said, \"I expect they will. The queen would not have waited long in any case. \\nRobert was becoming unruly, and she needed to be rid of him to free her hands to deal with his brothers. \\nThey are quite a pair, Stannis and Renly. The iron gauntlet and the silk glove.\" He wiped his mouth with \\nthe back of his hand. \"You have been foolish, my lord. You ought to have heeded Littlefinger when he \\nurged you to support Joffrey\\'s succession.\" \\n\"How . . . how could you know of that?\" \\nVarys smiled. \"I know, that\\'s all that need concern you. I also know that on the morrow the queen will \\npay you a visit.\" \\nSlowly Ned raised his eyes. \"Why?\" \\n\"Cersei is frightened of you, my lord . . . but she has other enemies she fears even more. Her beloved \\nJaime is fighting the river lords even now. Lysa Arryn sits in the Eyrie, ringed in stone and steel, and there \\nis no love lost between her and the queen. In Dorne, the Martells still brood on the murder of Princess \\nElia and her babes. And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.\" \\nPage 423\\n\\n\"Robb is only a boy,\" Ned said, aghast. \\n\"A boy with an army,\" Varys said. \"Yet only a boy, as you say. The king\\'s brothers are the ones giving \\nCersei sleepless nights . . . Lord Stannis in particular. His claim is the true one, he is known for his \\nprowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so \\nterrifying as a truly just man. No one knows what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone, but I will \\nwager you that he\\'s gathered more swords than seashells. So here is Cersei\\'s nightmare: while her father \\nand brother spend their power battling Starks and Tullys, Lord Stannis will land, proclaim himself king, \\nand lop off her son\\'s curly blond head . . . and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe she cares \\nmore about the boy.\" \\n\"Stannis Baratheon is Robert\\'s true heir,\" Ned said. \"The throne is his by rights. I would welcome his \\nascent.\" \\nVarys tsked. \"Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you. Stannis may win the throne, but only your \\nrotting head will remain to cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours. Sansa begged so sweetly, it \\nwould be a shame if you threw it all away. You are being given your life back, if you\\'ll take it. Cersei is \\nno fool. She knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one.\" \\n\"You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, butchered my men, and crippled my son?\" \\nNed\\'s voice was thick with disbelief. \\n\"I want you to serve the realm,\" Varys said. \"Tell the queen that you will confess your vile treason, \\ncommand your son to lay down his sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Offer to denounce \\nStannis and Renly as faithless usurpers. Our green-eyed lioness knows you are a man of honor. If you \\nwill give her the peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your \\ngrave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of your days on the Wall, with \\nyour brother and that baseborn son of yours.\" \\nThe thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow \\ntoo deep for words. If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with him . . . pain shot through his \\nbroken leg, beneath the filthy grey plaster of his cast. He winced, his fingers opening and closing \\nhelplessly. \"Is this your own scheme,\" he gasped out at Varys, \"or are you in league with Littlefinger?\" \\nThat seemed to amuse the eunuch. \"I would sooner wed the Black Goat of Qohor. Littlefinger is the \\nsecond most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms. Oh, I feed him choice whispers, sufficient so that he \\nthinks I am his . . . just as I allow Cersei to believe I am hers.\" \\n\"And just as you let me believe that you were mine. Tell me, Lord Varys, who do you truly serve?\" \\nVarys smiled thinly. \"Why, the realm, my good lord, how ever could you doubt that? I swear it by my \\nlost manhood. I serve the realm, and the realm needs peace.\" He finished the last swallow of wine, and \\ntossed the empty skin aside. \"So what is your answer, Lord Eddard? Give me your word that you\\'ll tell \\nthe queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling.\" \\n\"If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor. My life is not so precious to me as \\nthat.\" \\nPage 424\\n\\n\"Pity.\" The eunuch stood. \"And your daughter\\'s life, my lord? How precious is that?\" \\nA chill pierced Ned\\'s heart. \"My daughter \\n\"Surely you did not think I\\'d forgotten about your sweet innocent, my lord? The queen most certainly has \\nnot.\" \\n\"No, \" Ned pleaded, his voice cracking. \"Varys, gods have mercy, do as you like with me, but leave my \\ndaughter out of your schemes. Sansa\\'s no more than a child.\" \\n\"Rhaenys was a child too. Prince Rhaegar\\'s daughter. A precious little thing, younger than your girls. She \\nhad a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you know? I always wondered what happened to him. \\nRhaenys liked to pretend he was the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters \\ntaught her the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke down her \\ndoor.\" Varys gave a long weary sigh, the sigh of a man who carried all the sadness of the world in a sack \\nupon his shoulders. \"The High Septon once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer. If that\\'s true, Lord \\nEddard, tell me . . . why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when you high lords play your game \\nof thrones? Ponder it, if you would, while you wait upon the queen. And spare a thought for this as well: \\nThe next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and the milk of the poppy for your \\npain . . . or he could bring you Sansa\\'s head. \\n\"The choice, my dear lord Hand, is entirely yours.\" \\nCATELYN \\nAs the host trooped down the causeway through the black bogs of the Neck and spilled out into the \\nriverlands beyond, Catelyn\\'s apprehensions grew. She masked her fears behind a face kept still and \\nstern, yet they were there all the same, growing with every league they crossed. Her days were anxious, \\nher nights restless, and every raven that flew overhead made her clench her teeth. \\nShe feared for her lord father, and wondered at his ominous silence. She feared for her brother Edmure, \\nand prayed that the gods would watch over him if he must face the Kingslayer in battle. She feared for \\nNed and her girls, and for the sweet sons she had left behind at Winterfell. And yet there was nothing she \\ncould do for any of them, and so she made herself put all thought of them aside. You must save your \\nstrength for Robb, she told herself. He is the only one you can help. You must be as fierce and hard as \\nthe north, Catelyn Tully. You must be a Stark for true now, like your son. \\nRobb rode at the front of the column, beneath the flapping white banner of Winterfell. Each day he \\nwould ask one of his lords to join him, so they might confer as they marched; he honored every man in \\nturn, showing no favorites, listening as his lord father had listened, weighing the words of one against the \\nother. He has learned so much from Ned, she thought as she watched him, but has he learned enough? \\nThe Blackfish had taken a hundred picked men and a hundred swift \\nhorses and raced ahead to screen their movements and scout the way. The reports Ser Brynden\\'s riders \\nbrought back did little to reassure her. Lord Tywin\\'s host was still many days to the south . . . but Walder \\nPage 425\\n\\nFrey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a force of near four thousand men at his castles on the Green \\nFork. \\n\"Late again,\" Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all over, damn the man. Her brother \\nEdmure had called the banners; by rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun, \\nyet here he sat. \\n\"Four thousand men,\" Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. \"Lord Frey cannot hope to fight the \\nLannisters by himself. Surely he means to join his power to ours.\" \\n\"Does he?\" Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett Glover, his companion of \\nthe day. The vanguard spread out behind them, a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears. \\n\"I wonder. Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be surprised.\" \\n\"He\\'s your father\\'s bannerman.\" \\n\"Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb. And Lord Walder was always friendlier \\nwith Casterly Rock than my father would have liked. One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister\\'s sister. \\nThat means little of itself, to be sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years, and \\nthey must needs marry someone. Still . . .\" \\n\"Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?\" Robett Glover asked gravely. \\nCatelyn sighed. \"If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord Frey intends to do. He has \\nan old man\\'s caution and a young man\\'s ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.\" \\n\"We must have the Twins, Mother,\" Robb said heatedly. \"There is no other way across the river. You \\nknow that.\" \\n\"Yes. And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that.\" \\nThat night they made camp on the southern edge of the bogs, halfway between the kingsroad and the \\nriver. It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word from her uncle. \"Ser Brynden says to tell \\nyou he\\'s crossed swords with the Lannisters. There are a dozen scouts who won\\'t be reporting back to \\nLord Tywin anytime soon. Or ever.\" He grinned. \"Ser Addam Marbrand commands their outriders, and \\nhe\\'s pulling back south, burning as he goes. He knows where we are, more or less, but the Blackfish \\nvows he will not know when we split.\" \\n\"Unless Lord Frey tells him,\" Catelyn said sharply. \"Theon, when \\nyou return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day and night, with \\norders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements. I want no birds bringing word of my \\nson\\'s movements to Lord Tywin.\" \\n\"Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady,\" Theon replied with a cocky smile. \"A few more \\nblackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie. I\\'ll save you their feathers for a hat.\" \\nShe ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of her. \"What have the Freys \\nbeen doing while the Lannisters; burn their fields and plunder their holdfasts?\" \\nPage 426\\n\\n\"There\\'s been some fighting between Ser Addam\\'s men and Lord Walder\\'s,\" Theon answered. \"Not a \\nday\\'s ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them \\nup. Most of Lord Walder\\'s strength remains massed at the Twins, though.\" \\nThat bore Walder Frey\\'s seal beyond a doubt, Catelyn thought bitterly; hold back, wait, watch, take no \\nrisk unless forced to it. \\n\"If he\\'s been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his vows,\" Robb said. \\nCatelyn was less encouraged. \"Defending his own lands is one thing, open battle against Lord Tywin \\nquite another.\" \\nRobb turned back to Theon Greyjoy. \"Has the Blackfish found any other way across the Green Fork?\" \\nTheon shook his head. \"The river\\'s running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it can\\'t be forded, not this far \\nnorth.\" \\n\"I must have that crossing!\" Robb declared, fuming. \"Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I \\nsuppose, but not with armored men on their backs. We\\'d need to build rafts to pole our steel across, \\nhelms and mail and lances, and we don\\'t have the trees for that. Or the time. Lord Tywin is marching \\nnorth He balled his hand into a fist. \\n\"Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,\" Theon Greyjoy said with his customary easy \\nconfidence. \"We have five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.\" \\n\"Not easily,\" Catelyn warned them, \"and not in time. While you were mounting your siege, Tywin \\nLannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear.\" \\nRobb glanced from her to Greyjoy, searching for an answer and finding none. For a moment he looked \\neven younger than his fifteen years, despite his mail and sword and the stubble on his cheeks. \"What \\nwould my lord father do?\" he asked her. \\n\"Find a way across,\" she told him. \"Whatever it took.\" \\nThe next morning it was Ser Brynden Tully himself who rode back to them. He had put aside the heavy \\nplate and helm he\\'d worn as the Knight of the Gate for the lighter leather-and-mail of an outrider, but his \\nobsidian fish still fastened his cloak. \\nHer uncle\\'s face was grave as he swung down off his horse. \"There has been a battle under the walls of \\nRiverrun,\" he said, his mouth grim. \"We had it from a Lannister outrider we took captive. The Kingslayer \\nhas destroyed Edmure\\'s host and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight.\" \\nA cold hand clutched at Catelyn\\'s heart. \"And my brother?\" \\n\"Wounded and taken prisoner,\" Ser Brynden said. \"Lord Blackwood and the other survivors are under \\nsiege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaime\\'s host.\" \\nRobb looked fretful. \"We must get across this accursed river if we\\'re to have any hope of relieving them \\nPage 427\\n\\nin time.\" \\n\"That will not be easily done,\" her uncle cautioned. \"Lord Frey has pulled his whole strength back inside \\nhis castles, and his gates are closed and barred.\" \\n\"Damn the man,\" Robb swore. \"If the old fool does not relent and let me cross, he\\'ll leave me no choice \\nbut to storm his walls. I\\'ll pull the Twins down around his ears if I have to, we\\'ll see how well he likes \\nthat!\" \\n\"You sound like a sulky boy, Robb,\" Catelyn said sharply. \"A child sees an obstacle, and his first thought \\nis to run around it or knock it down. A lord must learn that sometimes words can accomplish what \\nswords cannot.\" \\nRobb\\'s neck reddened at the rebuke. \"Tell me what you mean, Mother,\" he said meekly. \\n\"The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they have never failed \\nto exact their toll.\" \\n\"What toll? What does he want?\" \\nShe smiled. \"That is what we must discover.\" \\n\"And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?\" \\n\"Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in battle . . . or grow wings. \\nI see no other choices.\" Catelyn put her heels to her horse and rode off, leaving her son to ponder her \\nwords. It would not do to make him feel as if his mother were usurping his place. Did you teach him \\nwisdom as well as valor, Ned? she wondered. Didyou teach him how to kneel? The graveyards of the \\nSeven Kingdoms were full of brave men who had never learned that lesson. \\nIt was near midday when their vanguard came in sight of the Twins, where the Lords of the Crossing had \\ntheir seat. \\nThe Green Fork ran swift and deep here, but the Freys had spanned it many centuries past and grown \\nrich off the coin men paid them to cross. Their bridge was a massive arch of smooth grey rock, wide \\nenough for two wagons to pass abreast; the Water Tower rose from the center of the span, commanding \\nboth road and river with its arrow slits, murder holes, and portcullises. It had taken the Freys three \\ngenerations to complete their bridge; when they were done they\\'d thrown up stout timber keeps on either \\nbank, so no one might cross without their leave. \\nThe timber had long since given way to stone. The Twins-two squat, ugly, formidable castles, identical in \\nevery respect, with the bridge arching between-had guarded the crossing for centuries. High curtain \\nwalls, deep moats, and heavy oak-and-iron gates protected the approaches, the bridge footings rose \\nfrom within stout inner keeps, there was a barbican and portcullis on either bank, and the Water Tower \\ndefended the span itself. \\nOne glance was sufficient to tell Catelyn that the castle would not be taken by storm. The battlements \\nbristled with spears and swords and scorpions, there was an archer at every crenel and arrow slit, the \\ndrawbridge was up, the portcullis down, the gates closed and barred. \\nPage 428\\n\\nThe Greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as he saw what awaited them. Lord Rickard Karstark \\nglowered in silence. \"That cannot be assaulted, my lords,\" Roose Bolton announced. \\n\"Nor can we take it by siege, without an army on the far bank to invest the other castle,\" Helman Tallhart \\nsaid gloomily. Across the deep-running green waters, the western twin stood like a reflection of its \\neastern brother. \"Even if we had the time. Which, to be sure, we do not.\" \\nAs the northern lords studied the castle, a sally port opened, a plank bridge slid across the moat, and a \\ndozen knights rode forth to confront them, led by four of Lord Walder\\'s many sons. Their banner bore \\ntwin towers, dark blue on a field of pale silver-grey. Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder\\'s heir, spoke for \\nthem. The Freys all looked like weasels; Ser Stevron, past sixty with grandchildren of his own, looked \\nlike an especially old and tired weasel, yet he was polite enough. \"My lord father has sent me to greet \\nyou, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host.\" \\n\"I do.\" Robb spurred his horse forward. He was in his armor, with the direwolf shield of Winterfell \\nstrapped to his saddle and Grey Wind padding by his side. \\nThe old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement \\nin his watery grey eyes, though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the direwolf. \"My \\nlord father would be most honored if you would share meat and mead with him in the castle and explain \\nyour purpose here.\" \\nHis words crashed among the lords bannermen like a great stone from a catapult. Not one of them \\napproved. They cursed, argued, shouted down each other. \\n\"You must not do this, my lord,\" Galbart Glover pleaded with Robb. \"Lord Walder is not to be trusted.\" \\nRoose Bolton nodded. \"Go in there alone and you\\'re his. He can sell you to the Lannisters, throw you in \\na dungeon, or slit your throat, as he likes.\" \\n\"If he wants to talk to us, let him open his gates, and we will all share his meat and mead,\" declared Ser \\nWendel Manderly. \\n\"Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of his men and ours,\" suggested his brother, \\nSer Wylis. \\nCatelyn Stark shared all their doubts, but she had only to glance at Ser Stevron to see that he was not \\npleased by what he was hearing. A few more words and the chance would be lost. She had to act, and \\nquickly. \"I will go, \" she said loudly. \\n\"You, my lady?\" The Greatjon furrowed his brow. \\n\"Mother, are you certain?\" Clearly, Robb was not. \\n\"Never more,\" Catelyn lied glibly. \"Lord Walder is my father\\'s bannerman. I have known him since I was \\na girt. He would never offer me any harm.\" Unless he saw some profit in it, she added silently, but some \\ntruths did not bear saying, and some lies were necessary. \\nPage 429\\n\\n\"I am certain my lord father would be pleased to speak to the Lady Catelyn,\" Ser Stevron said. \"To \\nvouchsafe for our good intentions, my brother Ser Perwyn will remain here until she is safely returned to \\nyou.,, \\n\"He shall be our honored guest,\" said Robb. Ser Perwyn, the youngest of the four Freys in the party, \\ndismounted and handed the reins of his horse to a brother. \"I require my lady mother\\'s return by evenfall, \\nSer Stevron,\" Robb went on. \"It is not my intent to linger here long.\" \\nSer Stevron Frey gave a polite nod. \"As you say, my lord.\" Catelyn spurred her horse forward and did \\nnot look back. Lord Walder\\'s sons and envoys fell in around her. \\nHer father had once said of Walder Frey that he was the only lord in the Seven Kingdoms who could \\nfield an army out of his breeches. When the Lord of the Crossing welcomed Catelyn in the great hall of \\nthe east castle, surrounded by twenty living sons (minus Ser Perwyn, who would have made twenty-one), \\nthirty-six grandsons, nineteen \\ngreat-grandsons, and numerous daughters, granddaughters, bastards, and grandbastards, she \\nunderstood just what he had meant. \\nLord Walder was ninety, a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head, too gouty to stand unassisted. \\nHis newest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years, walked beside his litter when they carried him in. She \\nwas the eighth Lady Frey. \\n\"It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord,\" Catelyn said. \\nThe old man squinted at her suspiciously. \"Is it? I doubt that. Spare me your sweet words, Lady \\nCatelyn, I am too old. Why are you here? Is your boy too proud to come before me himself? What am I \\nto do with you?\" \\nCatelyn had been a girl the last time she had visited the Twins, but even then Lord Walder had been \\nirascible, sharp of tongue, and blunt of manner. Age had made him worse than ever, it would seem. She \\nwould need to choose her words with care, and do her best to take no offense from his. \\n\"Father,\" Ser Stevron said reproachfully, \"you forget yourself. Lady Stark is here at your invitation.\" \\n\"Did I askyou? You are not Lord Frey yet, not until I die. Do I look dead? I\\'ll hear no instructions from \\nyou.\" \\n\"This is no way to speak in front of our noble guest, Father,\" one of his younger sons said. \\n\"Now my bastards presume to teach me courtesy,\" Lord Walder complained. \"I\\'ll speak any way I like, \\ndamn you. I\\'ve had three kings to guest in my life, and queens as well, do you think I require lessons from \\nthe likes of you, Ryger? Your mother was milking goats the first time I gave her my seed.\" He dismissed \\nthe red-faced youth with a flick of his fingers and gestured to two of his other sons. \"Danwell, Whalen, \\nhelp me to my chair.\" \\nThey shifted Lord Walder from his litter and carried him to the high seat of the Freys, a tall chair of black \\noak whose back was carved in the shape of two towers linked by a bridge. His young wife crept up \\nPage 430\\n\\ntimidly and covered his legs with a blanket. When he was settled, the old man beckoned Catelyn forward \\nand planted a papery dry kiss on her hand. \"There,\" he announced. \"Now that I have observed the \\ncourtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. Why are you here?\" \\n\"To ask you to open your gates, my lord,\" Catelyn replied politely. \"My son and his lords bannermen are \\nmost anxious to cross the river and be on their way.\" \\n\"To Riverrun?\" He sniggered. \"Oh, no need to tell me, no need. I\\'m not blind yet. The old man can still \\nread a map.\" \\n\"To Riverrun,\" Catelyn confirmed. She saw no reason to deny it. \"Where I might have expected to find \\nyou, my lord. You are still my father\\'s bannerman, are you not?\" \\n\"Heh, \" said Lord Walder, a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt. \"I called my swords, yes I did, \\nhere they are, you saw them on the walls. It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was \\nassembled. Well, to send my sons. I am well past marching myself, Lady Catelyn.\" He looked around for \\nlikely confirmation and pointed to a tall, stooped man of fifty years. \"Tell her, Jared. Tell her that was my \\nintent.\" \\n\"It was, my lady,\" said Ser Jared Frey, one of his sons by his second wife. \"On my honor.\" \\n\"Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march?\" He leaned back against his \\ncushions and scowled at her, as if challenging her to dispute his version of events. \"I am told the \\nKingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese. Why should my boys hurry south to die? \\nAll those who did go south are running north again.\" \\nCatelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roasted him over a fire, but she had only till \\nevenfall to open the bridge. Calmly, she said, \"All the more reason that we must reach Riverrun, and \\nsoon. Where can we go to talk, my lord?\" \\n\"We\\'re talking now,\" Lord Frey complained. The spotted pink head snapped around. \"What are you all \\nlooking at?\" he shouted at his kin. \"Get out of here. Lady Stark wants to speak to me in private. Might be \\nshe has designs on my fidelity, heh. Go, all of you, find something useful to do. Yes, you too, woman. \\nOut, out, out.\" As his sons and grandsons and daughters and bastards and nieces and nephews streamed \\nfrom the hall, he leaned close to Catelyn and confessed, \"They\\'re all waiting for me to die. Stevron\\'s been \\nwaiting for forty years, but I keep disappointing him. Heh. Why should I die just so he can be a lord? I \\nask you. I won\\'t do it.\" \\n\"I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred.\" \\n\"That would boil them, to be sure. Oh, to be sure. Now, what do you want to say?\" \\n\"We want to cross,\" Catelyn told him. \\n\"Oh, do you? That\\'s blunt. Why should I let you?\" \\nFor a moment her anger flared. \"If you were strong enough to climb your own battlements, Lord Frey, \\nyou would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside your walls.\" \\nPage 431\\n\\n\"They\\'ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here,\" the old man shot back. \"Don\\'t \\nyou try and frighten me, my lady. Your husband\\'s in some traitor\\'s cell under the Red Keep, your father\\'s \\nsick, might be dying, and Jaime Lannister\\'s got your brother in chains. What do you have that I should \\nfear? That son of yours? I\\'ll match you son for son, and I\\'ll still have eighteen when yours are all dead.\" \\n\"You swore an oath to my father,\" Catelyn reminded him. \\nHe bobbed his head side to side, smiling. \"Oh, yes, I said some words, but I swore oaths to the crown \\ntoo, it seems to me. Joffrey\\'s the king now, and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there \\nno better than rebels. If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I\\'d help the Lannisters boil you all.\" \\n\"Why don\\'t you?\" she challenged him. \\nLord Walder snorted with disdain. \"Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, Warden of the West, Hand of \\nthe King, oh, what a great man that one is, him and his gold this and gold that and lions here and lions \\nthere. I\\'ll wager you, he cats too many beans, he breaks wind just like me, but you\\'ll never hear him admit \\nit, oh, no. What\\'s he got to be so puffed up about anyway? Only two sons, and one of them\\'s a twisted \\nlittle monster. I\\'ll match him son for son, and I\\'ll still have nineteen and a half left when all of his are dead!\" \\nHe cackled. \"If Lord Tywin wants my help, he can bloody well ask for it.\" \\nThat was all Catelyn needed to hear. \"I am asking for your help, my lord,\" she said humbly. \"And my \\nfather and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are asking with my voice.\" \\nLord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face. \"Save your sweet words, my lady. Sweet words I get \\nfrom my wife. Did you see her? Sixteen she is, a little flower, and her honey\\'s only for me. I wager she \\ngives me a son by this time next year. Perhaps I\\'ll make him heir, wouldn\\'t that boil the rest of them?\" \\n\"I\\'m certain she will give you many sons.\" \\nHis head bobbed up and down. \"Your lord father did not come to the wedding. An insult, as I see it. \\nEven if he is dying. He never came to my last wedding either. He calls me the Late Lord Frey, you know. \\nDoes he think I\\'m dead? I\\'m not dead, and I promise you, I\\'ll outlive him as I outlived his father. Your \\nfamily has always pissed on me, don\\'t deny it, don\\'t lie, you know it\\'s true. Years ago, I went to your \\nfather and suggested a match between his son and my daughter. Why not? I had a daughter in mind, \\nsweet girl, only a few years older than Edmure, but if your brother didn\\'t warm to her, I had others he \\nmight have had, young ones, old ones, virgins, widows, whatever he wanted. \\nNo, Lord Hoster would not hear of it. Sweet words he gave me, excuses, but what I wanted was to get \\nrid of a daughter. \\n\"And your sister, that one, she\\'s full as bad. It was, oh, a year ago, no more, Jon Arryn was still the \\nKing\\'s Hand, and I went to the city to see my sons ride in the tourney. Stevron and Jared are too old for \\nthe lists now, but Danwell and Hosteen rode, Perwyn as well, and a couple of my bastards tried the \\nmelee. If I\\'d known how they\\'d shame me, I would never have troubled myself to make the journey. Why \\ndid I need to ride all that way to see Hosteen knocked off his horse by that Tyrell whelp? I ask you. The \\nboy\\'s half his age, Ser Daisy they call him, something like that. And Danwell was unhorsed by a hedge \\nknight! Some days I wonder if those two are truly mine. My third wife was a Crakehall, all of the \\nPage 432\\n\\nCrakehall women are sluts. Well, never mind about that, she died before you were born, what do you \\ncare? \\n\"I was speaking of your sister. I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn foster two of my grandsons at \\ncourt, and offered to take their own son to ward here at the Twins. Are my grandsons unworthy to be \\nseen at the king\\'s court? They are sweet boys, quiet and mannerly. Walder is Merrett\\'s son, named after \\nme, and the other one . . . heh, I don\\'t recall . . . he might have been another Walder, they\\'re always \\nnaming them Walder so I\\'ll favor them, but his father . . . which one was his father now?\" His face \\nwrinkled up. \"Well, whoever he was, Lord Arryn wouldn\\'t have him, or the other one, and I blame your \\nlady sister for that. She frosted up as if I\\'d suggested selling her boy to a mummer\\'s show or making a \\neunuch out of him, and when Lord Arryn said the child was going to Dragonstone to foster with Stannis \\nBaratheon, she stormed off without a word of regrets and all the Hand could give me was apologies. \\nWhat good are apologies? I ask you.\" \\nCatelyn frowned, disquieted. \"I had understood that Lysa\\'s boy was to be fostered with Lord Tywin at \\nCasterly Rock.\" \\n\"No, it was Lord Stannis,\" WaIder Frey said irritably. \"Do you think I can\\'t tell Lord Stannis from Lord \\nTywin? They\\'re both bungholes who think they\\'re too noble to shit, but never mind about that, I know the \\ndifference. Or do you think I\\'m so old I can\\'t remember? I\\'m ninety and I remember very well. I \\nremember what to do with a woman too. That wife of mine will give me a son before this time next year, \\nI\\'ll wager. Or a daughter, that can\\'t be helped. Boy or girl, it will be red, wrinkled, and squalling, and like \\nas not she\\'ll want to name it Walder or Walda.\" \\nCatelyn was not concerned with what Lady Frey might choose to name her child. \"Jon Arryn was going \\nto foster his son with Lord Stannis, you are quite certain of that?\" \\n\"Yes, yes, yes,\" the old man said. \"Only he died, so what does it matter? You say you want to cross the \\nriver?\" \\n\"We do.,\\' \\n\"Well, you can\\'t!\" Lord Walder announced crisply. \"Not unless I allow it, and why should I? The Tullys \\nand the Starks have never been friends of mine.\" He pushed himself back in his chair and crossed his \\narms, smirking, waiting for her answer. \\nThe rest was only haggling. \\nA swollen red sun hung low against the western hills when the gates of the castle opened. The \\ndrawbridge creaked down, the portcullis winched up, and Lady Catelyn Stark rode forth to rejoin her \\nson and his lords bannermen. Behind her came Ser Jared Frey, Ser Hosteen Frey, Ser Danwell Frey, \\nand Lord Walder\\'s bastard son Ronel Rivers, leading a long column of pikemen, rank on rank of shuffling \\nmen in blue steel ringmail and silvery grey cloaks. \\nRobb galloped out to meet her, with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion. \"It\\'s done,\" she told him. \\n\"Lord Walder will grant you your crossing. His swords are yours as well, less four hundred he means to \\nkeep back to hold the Twins. I suggest that you leave four hundred of your own, a mixed force of \\narchers and swordsmen. He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison . . . but make certain \\nyou give the command to a man you can trust. Lord Walder may need help keeping faith.\" \\nPage 433\\n\\n\"As you say, Mother,\" Robb answered, gazing at the ranks of pikemen. \"Perhaps . . . Ser Helman \\nTallhart, do you think?\" \\n\"A fine choice.\" \\n\"What . . . what did he want of us?\" \\n\"If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of Lord Frey\\'s grandsons north \\nto Winterfell,\" she told him. \"I have agreed to take them as wards. They are young boys, aged eight years \\nand seven. It would seem they are both named Walder. Your brother Bran will welcome the \\ncompanionship of lads near his own age, I should think.\" \\n\"Is that all? Two fosterlings? That\\'s a small enough price to-\" \\n\"Lord Frey\\'s son Olyvar will be coming with us,\" she went on. \"He is to serve as your personal squire. \\nHis father would like to see him knighted, in good time.\" \\n\"A squire.\" He shrugged. \"Fine, that\\'s fine, if he\\'s-\" \\n\"Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, it is agreed that she will marry Lord Walder\\'s youngest \\nson, Elmar, when the two of them come of age.\" \\nRobb looked nonplussed. \"Arya won\\'t like that one bit.\" \\n\"And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done,\" she finished. \"His lordship has \\ngraciously consented to allow you to choose whichever girl you prefer. He has a number he thinks might \\nbe suitable.\" \\nTo his credit, Robb did not flinch. \"I see.\" \\n\"Do you consent?\" \\n\"Can I refuse?\" \\n\"Not if you wish to cross.\" \\n\"I consent,\" Robb said solemnly. He had never seemed more manly to her than he did in that moment. \\nBoys might play with swords, but it took a lord to make a marriage pact, knowing what it meant. \\nThey crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river. The double column wound its way \\nthrough the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, slithering across the courtyard, into the keep \\nand over the bridge, to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank. \\nCatelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with her son and her uncle Ser Brynden and Ser Stevron Frey. \\nBehind followed nine tenths of their horse; knights, lancers, freeriders, and mounted bowmen. It took \\nhours for them all to cross. Afterward, Catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the \\ndrawbridge, the sight of Lord Walder Frey in his litter watching them pass, the glitter of eyes peering \\ndown through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as they rode through the Water Tower. \\nPage 434\\n\\nThe larger part of the northern host, pikes and archers and great masses of men-at-arms on foot, \\nremained upon the east bank under the command of Roose Bolton. Robb had commanded him to \\ncontinue the march south, to confront the huge Lannister army coming north under Lord Tywin. \\nFor good or ill, her son had thrown the dice. \\nJON \\nAre you well, Snow?\" Lord Mormont asked, scowling. \"Well, \" his raven squawked. \"Well. \" \\n\"I am, my lord,\" Jon lied . . . loudly, as if that could make it true. \"And you?\" \\nMormont frowned. \"A dead man tried to kill me. How well could I be?\" He scratched under his chin. \\nHis shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and he\\'d hacked it off. The pale stubble of his new \\nwhiskers made him look old, disreputable, and grumpy. \"You do not look well. How is your hand?\" \\n\"Healing.\" Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned himself more badly than he knew \\nthrowing the flaming drapes, and his right hand was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow. At the time he\\'d \\nfelt nothing; the agony had come after. His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters \\nrose between his fingers, big as roaches. \"The maester says I\\'ll have scars, but otherwise the hand should \\nbe as good as it was before.\" \\n\"A scarred hand is nothing. On the Wall, you\\'ll be wearing gloves often as not.\" \\n\"As you say, my lord.\" It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was the rest of it. Maester \\nAemon had given him milk of the poppy, yet even so, the pain had been hideous. At first it had felt as if \\nhis hand were still aflame, burning day and night. Only plunging it into \\nbasins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief at all. Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him \\nwrithing on his bed, whimpering from the pain. And when at last he did sleep, he dreamt, and that was \\neven worse. In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and his father\\'s face, but he \\ndared not tell Mormont that. \\n\"Dywen and Hake returned last night,\" the Old Bear said. \"They found no sign of your uncle, no more \\nthan the others did.\" \\n\"I know.\" Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends, and the failure of the \\nrangers\\' search had been all the men had been talking of. \\n\"You know,\" Mormont grumbled. \"How is it that everyone knows everything around here?\" He did not \\nseem to expect an answer. \"It would seem there were only the two of . . . of those creatures, whatever \\nthey were, I will not call them men. And thank the gods for that. Any more and . . . well, that doesn\\'t \\nbear thinking of. There will be more, though. I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon \\nagrees. The cold winds are rising. Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such as this world has \\nnever seen.\" \\nPage 435\\n\\nWinter is coming. The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to Jon as they did now. \"My \\nlord,\" he asked hesitantly, \"it\\'s said there was a bird last night \\n\"There was. What of it?\" \\n\"I had hoped for some word of my father.\" \\n\"Father, \" taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across Mormont\\'s shoulders. \"Father. \" \\nThe Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped up on his head, fluttered \\nits wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a window. \"Grief and noise,\" Mormont grumbled. \\n\"That\\'s all they\\'re good for, ravens. Why I put up with that pestilential bird . . . if there was news of Lord \\nEddard, don\\'t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you\\'re still his blood. The message \\nconcerned Ser Barristan Selmy. It seems he\\'s been removed from the Kingsguard. They gave his place to \\nthat black dog Clegane, and now Selmy\\'s wanted for treason. The fools sent some watchmen to seize \\nhim, but he slew two of them and escaped.\" Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of men \\nwho\\'d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold. \"We have white shadows in \\nthe woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a boy sits the Iron Throne,\" he said in disgust. \\nThe raven laughed shrilly. \"Boy, boy, boy, boy.\" \\nSer Barristan had been the Old Bear\\'s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had fallen, what chance was \\nthere that Mormont\\'s letter would be \\nheeded? He curled his hand into a fist. Pain shot through his burned fingers. \"What of my sisters?\" \\n\"The message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.\" He gave an irritated shrug. \"Perhaps they \\nnever got my letter. Aemon sent two copies, with his best birds, but who can say? More like, Pycelle did \\nnot deign to reply. It would not be the first time, nor the last. I fear we count for less than nothing in \\nKing\\'s Landing. They tell us what they want us to know, and that\\'s little enough.\" \\nAnd you tell me what you want me to know, and that\\'s less, Jon thought resentfully. His brother Robb \\nhad called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no word of that had been breathed to him . . . save \\nby Samwell Tarly, who\\'d read the letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in \\nsecret, all the time saying how he shouldn\\'t. Doubtless they thought his brother\\'s war was none of his \\nconcern. It troubled him more than he could say. Robb was marching and he was not. No matter how \\noften Jon told himself that his place was here now, with his new brothers on the Wall, he still felt craven. \\n\"Corn, \" the raven was crying. \"Corn, corn. \\n\"Oh, be quiet,\" the Old Bear told it. \"Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon say you\\'ll have use of that \\nhand back?\" \\n:, Soon,\" Jon replied. \\n\\'Good.\" On the table between them, Lord Mormont laid a large sword in a black metal scabbard \\nbanded with silver. \"Here. You\\'ll be ready for this, then.\" \\nThe raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutting toward the sword, head cocked curiously. \\nPage 436\\n\\nJon hesitated. He had no inkling what this meant. \"My lord?\" \\n\"The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip. Well, dry leather and old \\nwood, what could you expect? The blade, now . . . you\\'d need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the \\nblade.\" Mormont shoved the scabbard across the rough oak planks. \"I had the rest made anew. Take it.\" \\n\"Take it, \" echoed his raven, preening. \"Take it, take it. \\nAwkwardly, Jon took the sword in hand. His left hand; his bandaged right was still too raw and clumsy. \\nCarefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level with his eyes. \\nThe pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. It had been carved \\ninto the likeness of a snarling wolf\\'s head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin \\nleather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer \\nthan those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as \\nwell as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two-handed \\ngreatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a \"bastard sword.\" Yet the wolf sword \\nactually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see \\nthe ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again. \"This is \\nValyrian steel, my lord,\" he said wonderingly. His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the \\nlook, the feel. \\n\"It is,\" the Old Bear told him. \"It was my father\\'s sword, and his father\\'s before him. The Mormonts have \\ncarried it for five centuries. I wielded it in my day and passed it on to my son when I took the black.\" \\nHe is giving me his son\\'s sword. Jon could scarcely believe it. The blade was exquisitely balanced. The \\nedges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light. \"Your son-\" \\n\"My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to leave the sword behind \\nwhen he fled. My sister returned it to my keeping, but the very sight of it reminded me of Jorah\\'s shame, \\nso I put it aside and thought no more of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber. The original \\npommel was a bear\\'s head, silver, yet so worn its features were all but indistinguishable. For you, I \\nthought a white wolf more apt. One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.\" \\nWhen Jon had been Bran\\'s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys always did. The details \\nof his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he imagined saving his father\\'s life. Afterward \\nLord Eddard would declare that Jon had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. Even \\nthen he had known it was only a child\\'s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father\\'s sword. Even \\nthe memory shamed him. What kind of man stole his own brother\\'s birthright? I have no right to this, he \\nthought, no more than to ke. He twitched his burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin. \\n\"My lord, you honor me, but-\" \\n\"Spare me your but\\'s, boy,\" Lord Mormont interrupted. \"I would not be sitting here were it not for you \\nand that beast of yours. You fought bravely . . . and more to the point, you thought quickly. Fire! Yes, \\ndamn it. We ought to have known. We ought to have remembered. The Long Night has come before. \\nOh, eight thousand years is a good while, to be sure . . . yet if the Night\\'s Watch does not remember, \\nwho will?\" \\nPage 437\\n\\n\"Who will, \" chimed the talkative raven. \"\"o will. \\nTruly, the gods had heard Jon\\'s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the dead man\\'s clothing and \\nconsumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his \\neyes to see the thing staggering across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It \\nwas the face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, the dead flesh \\nmelting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone beneath. \\nWhatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the twisted thing they had \\nfound in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and charred bone. Yet in his nightmare he faced \\nit again . . . and this time the burning corpse wore Lord Eddard\\'s features. It was his father\\'s skin that \\nburst and blackened, his father\\'s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears. Jon did not \\nunderstand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him more than he could say. \\n\"A sword\\'s small payment for a life,\" Mormont concluded. \"Take it, I\\'ll hear no more of it, is that \\nunderstood?\" \\n\"Yes, my lord.\" The soft leather gave beneath Jon\\'s fingers, as if the sword were molding itself to his grip \\nalready. He knew he should be honored, and he was, and yet . . . \\nHe is not my father. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon\\'s mind. Lord Eddard Stark is my father. I will not \\nforget him, no matter how many swords they give me. Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it \\nwas another man\\'s sword he dreamt of . . . \\n\"I want no courtesies either,\" Mormont said, \"so thank me no thanks. Honor the steel with deeds, not \\nwords.\" \\nJon nodded. \"Does it have a name, my lord?\" \\n\"It did, once. Longclaw, it was called.\" \\n\"Claw, \" the raven cried. \"Claw. \" \\n\"Longclaw is an apt name.\" Jon tried a practice cut. He was clumsy and uncomfortable with his left hand, \\nyet even so the steel seemed to flow through the air, as if it had a will of its own. \"Wolves have claws, as \\nmuch as bears.\" \\nThe Old Bear seemed pleased by that. \"I suppose they do. You\\'ll want to wear that over the shoulder, I \\nimagine. It\\'s too long for the hip, at least until you\\'ve put on a few inches. And you\\'ll need to work at your \\ntwo-handed strikes as well. Ser Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.\" \\n\"Ser Endrew?\" Jon did not know the name. \\n\"Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man. He\\'s on his way from the Shadow Tower to assume the duties of \\nmaster-at-arms. Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.\" \\nJon lowered the sword. \"Why?\" he said, stupidly. \\nPage 438\\n\\nMormont snorted. \"Because I sent him, why do you think? He\\'s \\nbringing the hand your Ghost tore off the end of Jafer Flowers\\'s wrist. I have commanded him to take \\nship to King\\'s Landing and lay it before this boy king. That should get young Joffrey\\'s attention, I\\'d think . \\n. . and Ser Alliser\\'s a knight, highborn, anointed, with old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than \\na glorified crow.\" \\n\"Crow. \" Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant. \\n\"As well,\" the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird\\'s protest, \"it puts a thousand leagues twixt \\nhim and you without it seeming a rebuke.\" He jabbed a finger up at Jon\\'s face. \"And don\\'t think this \\nmeans I approve of that nonsense in the common hall. Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly, but \\nyou\\'re not a boy anymore, however many years you\\'ve seen. That\\'s a man\\'s sword you have there, and it \\nwill take a man to wield her. I\\'ll expect you to act the part, henceforth.\" \\n\"Yes, my lord.\" Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard. If not the blade he would have \\nchosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, and freeing him from Alliser Thorne\\'s malignance was nobler still. \\nThe Old Bear scratched at his chin. \"I had forgotten how much a new beard itches,\" he said. \"Well, no \\nhelp for that. Is that hand of yours healed enough to resume your duties?\" \\n\"Yes, my lord.\" \\n\"Good. The night will be cold, I\\'ll want hot spice wine. Find me a flagon of red, not too sour, and don\\'t \\nskimp on the spices. And tell Hobb that if he sends me boiled mutton again I\\'m like to boil him. That last \\nhaunch was grey. Even the bird wouldn\\'t touch it.\" He stroked the raven\\'s head with his thumb, and the \\nbird made a contented quorking sound. \"Away with you. I\\'ve work to do.\" \\nThe guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the turret stair, carrying the sword \\nin his good hand. \"Sweet steel,\" one man said. \"You earned that, Snow,\" another told him. Jon made \\nhimself smile back at them, but his heart was not in it. He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel \\nit. His hand ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who he was \\nangry with or why. \\nA half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King\\'s Tower, where Lord Commander \\nMormont now made his residence. They\\'d hung a target on the granary doors, so they could seem to be \\nhoning their skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw them. No sooner did he emerge than Pyp \\ncalled out, \"Well, come about, let\\'s have a look.\" \\n\"At what?\" Jon said. \\nToad sidled close. \"Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?\" \\n\"The sword,\" Grenn stated. \"We want to see the sword.\" \\nJon raked them with an accusing look. \"You knew.\" \\nPage 439\\n\\nPyp grinned. \"We\\'re not all as dumb as Grenn.\" \\n\"You are so,\" insisted Grenn. \"You\\'re dumber.\" \\nHalder gave an apologetic shrug. \"I helped Pate carve the stone for the pommel,\" the builder said, \"and \\nyour friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole\\'s Town.\" \\n\"We knew even before that, though,\" Grenn said. \"Rudge has been helping Donal Noye in the forge. He \\nwas there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt blade.\" \\n\"The sword!\" Matt insisted. The others took up the chant. \"The sword, the sword, the sword.\" \\nJon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that so they could admire it. The \\nbastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and deadly. \"Valyrian steel,\" he declared solemnly, trying \\nto sound as pleased and proud as he ought to have felt. \\n\"I heard of a man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,\" declared Toad. \"He cut his head off trying to \\nshave.\" \\nPyp grinned. \"The Night\\'s Watch is thousands of years old,\" he said, \"but I\\'ll wager Lord Snow\\'s the first \\nbrother ever honored for burning down the Lord Commander\\'s Tower.\" \\nThe others laughed, and even Jon had to smile. The fire he\\'d started had not, in truth, burned down that \\nformidable stone tower, but it had done a fair job of gutting the interior of the top two floors, where the \\nOld Bear had his chambers. No one seemed to mind that very much, since it had also destroyed Othor\\'s \\nmurderous corpse. \\nThe other wight, the one-handed thing that had once been a ranger named Jafer Flowers, had also been \\ndestroyed, cut near to pieces by a dozen swords . . . but not before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and \\nfour other men. Ser Jaremy had finished the job of hacking its head off, yet had died all the same when \\nthe headless corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels. Strength and \\ncourage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they were already dead; even \\narms and armor offered small protection. \\nThat grim thought soured Jon\\'s fragile mood. \"I need to see Hobb about the Old Bear\\'s supper,\" he \\nannounced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its scabbard. His friends meant well, but they did not \\nunderstand. It was not their fault, truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow \\nof those dead blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers. Nor did they know of the \\nfighting in the riverlands. How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away from them abruptly and \\nstrode off, sullen. Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no mind. \\nThey had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin\\'s Tower after the fire, and it was there \\nhe returned. Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door, but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon\\'s \\nboots. The direwolf\\'s red eyes were darker than garnets and wiser than men. Jon knelt, scratched his ear, \\nand showed him the pommel of the sword. \"Look. It\\'s you.\" \\nGhost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick. Jon smiled. \"You\\'re the one deserves an \\nhonor,\" he told the wolf . . . and suddenly he found himself remembering how he\\'d found him, that day in \\nthe late summer snow. They had been riding off with the other pups, but Jon had heard a noise and \\nPage 440\\n\\nturned back, and there he was, white fur almost invisible against the drifts. He was all alone, he thought, \\napart from the others in the litter. He was different, so they drove him out. \\n\"Jon?\" He looked up. Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels. His cheeks were red, and he \\nwas wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look ready for hibernation. \\n\"Sam.\" Jon stood. \"What is it? Do you want to see the sword?\" If the others had known, no doubt Sam \\ndid too. \\nThe fat boy shook his head. \"I was heir to my father\\'s blade once,\" he said mournfully. \"Heartsbane. \\nLord Randyll let me hold it a few times, but it always scared me. It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so \\nsharp I was afraid I\\'d hurt one of my sisters. Dickon will have it now.\" He wiped sweaty hands on his \\ncloak. \"I ah . . . Maester Aemon wants to see you.\" \\nIt was not time for his bandages to be changed. Jon frowned suspiciously. \"Why?\" he demanded. Sam \\nlooked miserable. That was answer enough. \"You told him, didn\\'t you?\" Jon said angrily. \"You told him \\nthat you told me.\" \\n\"I . . . he . . . Jon, I didn\\'t want to . . . he asked . . . I mean I think he knew, he sees things no one else \\nsees . . .\" \\n\"He\\'s blind,\" Jon pointed out forcefully, disgusted. \"I can find the way myself.\" He left Sam standing \\nthere, openmouthed and quivering. \\nHe found Maester Aemon up in the rookery, feeding the ravens. Clydas was with him, carrying a bucket \\nof chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage. \"Sam said you wanted me?\" \\nThe maester nodded. \"I did indeed. Clydas, give Jon the bucket. Perhaps he will be kind enough to \\nassist me.\" The hunched, pink-eyed brother handed Jon the bucket and scurried down the ladder. \"Toss \\nthe meat into the cages,\" Aemon instructed him. \"The birds will do the rest. \" \\nJon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the bloody bits. The ravens began to \\nscream noisily and fly at the bars, \\nbeating at the metal with night-black wings. The meat had been chopped into pieces no larger than a \\nfinger joint. He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, and the squawking and \\nsquabbling grew hotter. Feathers flew as two of the larger birds fought over a choice piece. Quickly Jon \\ngrabbed a second handful and threw it in after the first. \"Lord Mormont\\'s raven likes fruit and corn.\" \\n\"He is a rare bird,\" the maester said. \"Most ravens will eat grain, but they prefer flesh. It makes them \\nstrong, and I fear they relish the taste of blood. In that they are like men . . . and like men, not all ravens \\nare alike.\" \\nJon had nothing to say to that. He threw meat, wondering why he\\'d been summoned. No doubt the old \\nman would tell him, in his own good time. Maester Aemon was not a man to be hurried. \\n\"Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,\" the maester went on, \"though the raven is a \\nstronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend itself against hawks . . . yet ravens are \\nblack, and they eat the dead, so some godly men abhor them. Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the \\nPage 441\\n\\nravens with doves, did you know?\" The maester turned his white eyes on Jon, smiling. \"The Night\\'s \\nWatch prefers ravens.\" \\nJon\\'s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist. \"Dywen says the wildlings call us crows,\" he said \\nuncertainty. \\n\"The crow is the raven\\'s poor cousin. They are both beggars in black, hated and misunderstood.\" \\nJon wished he understood what they were talking about, and why. What did he care about ravens and \\ndoves? If the old man had something to say to him, why couldn\\'t he just say it? \\n\"Jon, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night\\'s Watch take no wives and father no children?\" \\nMaester Aemon asked. \\nJon shrugged. \"No.\" He scattered more meat. The fingers of his left hand were slimy with blood, and his \\nright throbbed from the weight of the bucket. \\n\"So they will not love,\" the old man answered, \"for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty.\" \\nThat did not sound right to Jon, yet he said nothing. The maester was a hundred years old, and a high \\nofficer of the Night\\'s Watch; it was not his place to contradict him. \\nThe old man seemed to sense his doubts. \"Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever come when your lord \\nfather must needs choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would \\nhe do?\" \\nJon hesitated. He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never \\ndishonor himself, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, He fathered a bastard, where \\nwas the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to her, he will not even say her name. \"He \\nwould do whatever was right,\" he said . . . ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. \"No matter what.\" \\n\"Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to \\na woman\\'s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms . . . or the memory of a \\nbrother\\'s smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us \\nfor love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy. \\n\"The men who formed the Night\\'s Watch knew that only their courage shielded the realm from the \\ndarkness to the north. They knew they must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve. So they \\nvowed they would have no wives nor children. \\n\"Yet brothers they had, and sisters. Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names. They \\ncame from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they knew times may change, but men do not. So they \\npledged as well that the Night\\'s Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded. \\n\"They kept their pledge. When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his kingdom, Harren\\'s brother \\nwas Lord Commander on the Wall, with ten thousand swords to hand. He did not march. In the days \\nwhen the Seven Mngdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them \\nwere not at war. The Watch took no part. When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away the \\nPage 442\\n\\nkingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at their \\nposts. So it has always been, for years beyond counting. Such is the price of honor. \\n\"A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear. And we all do our duty, when \\nthere is no cost to it. How easy it seems then, to walk the path of honor. Yet soon or late in every man\\'s \\nlife comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.\" \\nSome of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangling from their beaks. The rest seemed \\nto be watching him. Jon could feel the weight of all those tiny black eyes. \"And this is my day . . . is that \\nwhat you\\'re saying?\" \\nMaester Aemon turned his head and looked at him with those dead white eyes. It was as if he were \\nseeing right into his heart. Jon felt naked and exposed. He took the bucket in both hands and flung the \\nrest of the slops through the bars. Strings of meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens. They \\ntook to the air, shrieking \\nwildly. The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them down greedily. Jon let the \\nempty bucket clang to the floor. \\nThe old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder. \"It hurts, boy,\" he said softly. \"Oh, yes. \\nChoosing . . . it has always hurt. And always will. I know.\" \\n\"You don\\'t know,\" Jon said bitterly. \"No one knows. Even if I am his bastard, he\\'s still my father . . .\" \\nMaester Aemon sighed. \"Have you heard nothing I\\'ve told you, Jon? Do you think you are the first?\" He \\nshook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. \"Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. \\nOnce when I was a boy, once in the fullness of my manhood, and once when I had grown old. By then \\nmy strength was fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens would \\nbring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my House, the death of my kin, \\ndisgrace and desolation. What could I have done, old, blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet \\nstill it grieved me to sit forgotten as they cut down my brother\\'s poor grandson, and his son, and even the \\nlittle children . . .\" \\nJon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man\\'s eyes. \"Who are you?\" he asked quietly, \\nalmost in dread. \\nA toothless smile quivered on the ancient lips. \"Only a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle \\nBlack and the Night\\'s Watch. In my order, we put aside our house names when we take our vows and \\ndon the collar.\" The old man touched the maester\\'s chain that hung loosely around his thin, fleshless neck. \\n\"My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead. My \\ngrandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending \\non which tale you believe. Aemon, he called me . . .\" \\n\"Aemon . . . Targaryen?\" Jon could scarcely believe it. \\n\"Once,\" the old man said. \"Once. So you see, Jon, I do know . . . and knowing, I will not tell you stay or \\ngo. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it all the rest of your days. As I have.\" His voice \\nfell to a whisper. \"As I have . . .\" \\nPage 443\\n\\nDAENERYS \\nWhen the battle was done, Dany rode her silver through the fields of the dead. Her handmaids and the \\nmen of her khas came after, smiling and jesting among themselves. \\nDothraki hooves had torn the earth and trampled the rye and lentils into the ground, while arakhs and \\narrows had sown a terrible new crop and watered it with blood. Dying horses lifted their heads and \\nscreamed at her as she rode past. Wounded men moaned and prayed. Jaqqa rhan moved among them, \\nthe mercy men with their heavy axes, taking a harvest of heads from the dead and dying alike. After them \\nwould scurry a flock of small girls, pulling arrows from the corpses to fill their baskets. Last of all the \\ndogs would come sniffing, lean and hungry, the feral pack that was never far behind the khalasar. \\nThe sheep had been dead longest. There seemed to be thousands of them, black with flies, arrow shafts \\nbristling from each carcass. Khal Ogo\\'s riders had done that, Dany knew; no man of Drogo\\'s khalasar \\nwould be such a fool as to waste his arrows on sheep when there were shepherds yet to kill. \\nThe town was afire, black plumes of smoke roiling and tumbling as they rose into a hard blue sky. \\nBeneath broken walls of dried mud, riders galloped back and forth, swinging their long whips as they \\nherded the survivors from the smoking rubble. The women and chil \\ndren of Ogo\\'s khalasar walked with a sullen pride, even in defeat and bondage; they were slaves now, \\nbut they seemed not to fear it. It was different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them; she remembered \\nwhat terror felt like. Mothers stumbled along with blank, dead faces, pulling sobbing children by the \\nhand. There were only a few men among them, cripples and cowards and grandfathers. \\nSer Jorah said the people of this country named themselves the Lhazareen, but the Dothraki called them \\nhaesh rakhi, the Lamb Men. Once Dany might have taken them for Dothraki, for they had the same \\ncopper skin and almond-shaped eyes. Now they looked alien to her, squat and flat-faced, their black \\nhair cropped unnaturally short. They were herders of sheep and eaters of vegetables, and Khal Drogo \\nsaid they belonged south of the river bend. The grass of the Dothraki sea was not meant for sheep. \\nDany saw one boy bolt and run for the river. A rider cut him off and turned him, and the others boxed \\nhim in, cracking their whips in his face, running him this way and that. One galloped behind him, lashing \\nhim across the buttocks until his thighs ran red with blood. Another snared his ankle with a lash and sent \\nhim sprawling. Finally, when the boy could only crawl, they grew bored of the sport and put an arrow \\nthrough his back. \\nSer Jorah met her outside the shattered gate. He wore a dark green surcoat over his mail. His gauntlets, \\ngreaves, and greathelm were dark grey steel. The Dothraki had mocked him for a coward when he \\ndonned his armor, but the knight had spit insults right back in their teeth, tempers had flared, longsword \\nhad clashed with arakh, and the rider whose taunts had been loudest had been left behind to bleed to \\ndeath. \\nSer Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up. \"Your lord husband awaits you \\nwithin the town.\" \\n\"Drogo took no harm?\" \\nPage 444\\n\\n\"A few cuts,\" Ser Jorah answered, \"nothing of consequence. He slew two khals this day. Khal Ogo first, \\nand then the son, Fogo, who became khal when Ogo fell. His bloodriders cut the bells from their hair, \\nand now Khal Drogo\\'s every step rings louder than before.\" \\nOgo and his son had shared the high bench with her lord husband at the naming feast where Viserys had \\nbeen crowned, but that was in Vaes Dothrak, beneath the Mother of Mountains, where every rider was \\na brother and all quarrels were put aside. It was different out in the grass. Ogo\\'s khalasar had been \\nattacking the town when Khal Drogo caught him. She wondered what the Lamb Men had thought, when \\nthey first saw the dust of their horses from atop those crackedmud \\nwalls. Perhaps a few, the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods heard the \\nprayers of desperate men, took it for deliverance. \\nAcross the road, a girl no older than Dany was sobbing in a high thin voice as a rider shoved her over a \\npile of corpses, facedown, and thrust himself inside her. Other riders dismounted to take their turns. That \\nwas the sort of deliverance the Dothraki brought the Lamb Men. \\nI am the blood of the dragon, Daenerys Targaryen reminded herself as she turned her face away. She \\npressed her lips together and hardened her heart and rode on toward the gate. \\n\"Most of Ogo\\'s riders fled,\" Ser Jorah was saying. \"Still, there may be as many as ten thousand \\ncaptives.\" \\nSlaves, Dany thought. Khal Drogo would drive them downriver to one of the towns on Slaver\\'s Bay. \\nShe wanted to cry, but she told herself that she must be strong. This is war, this is what it looks like, this \\nis the price of the Iron Throne. \\n\"I\\'ve told the khal he ought to make for Meereen,\" Ser Jorah said. \"They\\'ll pay a better price than he\\'d \\nget from a slaving caravan. Illyrio writes that they had a plague last year, so the brothels are paying \\ndouble for healthy young girls, and triple for boys under ten. If enough children survive the journey, the \\ngold will buy us all the ships we need, and hire men to sail them.\" \\nBehind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending sound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on \\nand on. Dany\\'s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she turned the silver\\'s head. \"Make them stop,\" \\nshe commanded Ser Jorah. \\n\"Khaleesi?\" The knight sounded perplexed. \\n\"You heard my words,\" she said. \"Stop them.\" She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki. \\n\"Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah. I want no rape.\" \\nThe warriors exchanged a baffled look. \\nJorah Mormont spurred his horse closer. \"Princess,\" he said, \"you have a gentle heart, but you do not \\nunderstand. This is how it has always been. Those men have shed blood for the khal. Now they claim \\ntheir reward.\" \\nAcross the road, the girl was still crying, her high singsong tongue strange to Dany\\'s ears. The first man \\nPage 445\\n\\nwas done with her now, and a second had taken his place. \\n\"She is a lamb girl,\" Quaro said in Dothraki. \"She is nothing, Khaleesi. The riders do her honor. The \\nLamb Men lay with sheep, it is known.\" \\n\"It is known,\" her handmaid Irri echoed. \\n\"It is known,\" agreed Jhogo, astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given him. \"If her wailing offends \\nyour ears, Khaleesi, Jhogo will bring you her tongue.\" He drew his arakh. \\n\"I will not have her harmed,\" Dany said. \"I claim her. Do as I command you, or Khal Drogo will know \\nthe reason why.\" \\n\\'Ai, Khaleesi,\" Jhogo replied, kicking his horse. Quaro and the others followed his lead, the bells in their \\nhair chiming. \\n\"Go with them,\" she commanded Ser Jorah. \\n\"As you command.\" The knight gave her a curious look. \"You are your brother\\'s sister, in truth.\" \\n\"Viserys?\" She did not understand. \\n\"No,\" he answered. \"Rhaegar.\" He galloped off. \\nDany heard Jhogo shout. The rapers laughed at him. One man shouted back. Jhogo\\'s arakh flashed, and \\nthe man\\'s head went tumbling from his shoulders. Laughter turned to curses as the horsemen reached for \\nweapons, but by then Quaro and Aggo and Rakharo were there. She saw Aggo point across the road to \\nwhere she sat upon her silver. The riders looked at her with cold black eyes. One spat. The others \\nscattered to their mounts, muttering. \\nAll the while the man atop the lamb girl continued to plunge in and out of her, so intent on his pleasure \\nthat he seemed unaware of what was going on around him. Ser Jorah dismounted and wrenched him off \\nwith a mailed hand. The Dothraki went sprawling in the mud, bounced up with a knife in hand, and died \\nwith Aggo\\'s arrow through his throat. Mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her in \\nhis blood-spattered cloak. He led her across the road to Dany. \"What do you want done with her?\" \\nThe girl was trembling, her eyes wide and vague. Her hair was matted with blood. \"Doreah, see to her \\nhurts. You do not have a rider\\'s look, perhaps she will not fear you. The rest, with me.\" She urged the \\nsilver through the broken wooden gate. \\nIt was worse inside the town. Many of the houses were afire, and the jaqqa rhan had been about their \\ngrisly work. Headless corpses filled the narrow, twisty lanes. They passed other women being raped. \\nEach time Dany reined up, sent her khas to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave. One of \\nthem, a thick-bodied, flat-nosed woman of forty years, blessed Dany haltingly in the Common Tongue, \\nbut from the others she got only flat black stares. They were suspicious of her, she realized with sadness; \\nafraid that she had saved them for some worse fate. \\n\"You cannot claim them all, child,\" Ser Jorah said, the fourth time \\nPage 446\\n\\nthey stopped, while the warriors of her khas herded her new slaves behind her. \\n\"I am khaleesi, heir to the Seven Kingdoms, the blood of the dragon,\" Dany reminded him. \"It is not for \\nyou to tell me what I cannot do.\" Across the city, a building collapsed in a great gout of fire and smoke, \\nand she heard distant screams and the wailing of frightened children. \\nThey found Khal Drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick mud walls and a bulbous \\ndome like some immense brown onion. Beside him was a pile of heads taller than he was. One of the \\nshort arrows of the Lamb Men stuck through the meat of his upper arm, and blood covered the left side \\nof his bare chest like a splash of paint. His three bloodriders were with him. \\nJhiqui helped Dany dismount; she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger and heavier. She knelt \\nbefore the khaL \"My sun-and-stars is wounded.\" The arakh cut was wide but shallow; his left nipple was \\ngone, and a flap of bloody flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag. \\n\"Is scratch, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo,\" Khal Drogo said in the Common \\nTongue. \"I kill him for it, and Ogo too.\" He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringing softly. \"Is Ogo \\nyou hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him.\" \\n\"No man can stand before the sun of my life,\" Dany said, \"the father of the stallion who mounts the \\nworld.\" \\nA mounted warrior rode up and vaulted from his saddle. He spoke to Haggo, a stream of angry \\nDothraki too fast for Dany to understand. The huge bloodrider gave her a heavy look before he turned to \\nhis khaL \"This one is Mago, who rides in the khas of Ko Jhaqo. He says the khaleesi has taken his \\nspoils, a daughter of the lambs who was his to mount.\" \\nKhal Drogo\\'s face was still and hard, but his black eyes were curious as they went to Dany. \"Tell me the \\ntruth of this, moon of my life,\" he commanded in Dothraki. \\nDany told him what she had done, in his own tongue so the khal would understand her better, her words \\nsimple and direct. \\nWhen she was done, Drogo was frowning. \"This is the way of war. These women are our slaves now, to \\ndo with as we please.\" \\n\"It pleases me to hold them safe,\" Dany said, wondering if she had dared too much. \"If your warriors \\nwould mount these women, let them take them gently and keep them for wives. Give them places in the \\nkhalasar and let them bear you sons.\" \\nQotho was ever the cruelest of the bloodriders. It was he who laughed. \"Does the horse breed with the \\nsheep?\" \\nSomething in his tone reminded her of Viserys. Dany turned on him angrily. \"The dragon feeds on horse \\nand sheep alike.\" \\nKhal Drogo smiled. \"See how fierce she grows!\" he said. \"It is my son inside her, the stallion who \\nPage 447\\n\\nmounts the world, filling her with his fire. Ride slowly, Ootho . . . if the mother does not burn you where \\nyou sit, the son will trample you into the mud. And you, Mago, hold your tongue and find another lamb to \\nmount. These belong to my khaleesi.\" He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys, but as he lifted his arm \\nDrogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head. \\nDany could almost feel his agony. The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had led her to believe. \\n\"Where are the healers?\" she demanded. The khalasar had two sorts: barren women and eunuch slaves. \\nThe herbwomen dealt in potions and spells, the eunuchs in knife, needle, and fire. \"Why do they not \\nattend the khal?\" \\n\"The khal sent the hairless men away, Khaleesi,\" old Cohollo assured her. Dany saw the bloodrider had \\ntaken a wound himself; a deep gash in his left shoulder. \\n\"Many riders are hurt,\" Khal Drogo said stubbornly. \"Let them be healed first. This arrow is no more \\nthan the bite of a fly, this little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son.\" \\nDany could see the muscles in his chest where the skin had been cut away. A trickle of blood ran from \\nthe arrow that pierced his arm. \"It is not for Khal Drogo to wait,\" she proclaimed. \"Jhogo, seek out these \\neunuchs and bring them here at once.\" \\n\"Silver Lady,\" a woman\\'s voice said behind her, \"I can help the Great Rider with his hurts.\" \\nDany turned her head. The speaker was one of the slaves she had claimed, the heavy, flat-nosed woman \\nwho had blessed her. \\n\"The khal needs no help from women who lie with sheep,\" barked Qotho. \"Aggo, cut out her tongue.\" \\nAggo grabbed her hair and pressed a knife to her throat. \\nDany lifted a hand. \"No. She is mine. Let her speak.\" \\nAggo looked from her to Qotho. He lowered his knife. \\n\"I meant no wrong, fierce riders.\" The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes she wore had once been \\nthe lightest and finest of woolens, rich with embroidery, but now they were mud-caked and bloody and \\nripped. She clutched the torn cloth of her bodice to her heavy breasts. \"I have some small skill in the \\nhealing arts.\" \\n\"Who are you?\" Dany asked her. \\n\"I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I am godswife of this temple.\" \\n\"Maegi,\" grunted Haggo, fingering his arakh. His look was dark. Dany remembered the word from a \\nterrifying story that Jhiqui had told her one night by the cookfire. A maegi was a woman who lay with \\ndemons and practiced the blackest of sorceries, a vile thing, evil and soulless, who came to men in the \\ndark of night and sucked life and strength from their bodies. \\n\"I am a healer,\" Mirri Maz Duur said. \\nPage 448\\n\\n\"A healer of sheeps,\" sneered Qotho. \"Blood of my blood, I say kill this maegi and wait for the hairless \\nmen.\" \\nDany ignored the bloodrider\\'s outburst. This old, homely, thickbodied woman did not look like a maegi \\nto her. \"Where did you learn your healing, Mirri Maz Duur?\" \\n\"My mother was godswife before me, and taught me all the songs and spells most pleasing to the Great \\nShepherd, and how to make the sacred smokes and ointments from leaf and root and berry. When I was \\nyounger and more fair, I went in caravan to Asshai by the Shadow, to learn from their mages. Ships from \\nmany lands come to Asshai, so I lingered long to study the healing ways of distant peoples. A moonsinger \\nof the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a woman of your own riding people taught me the \\nmagics of grass and corn and horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and \\nshowed me all the secrets that hide beneath the skin.\" \\nSer Jorah Mormont spoke up. \"A maester?\" \\n\"Marwyn, he named himself,\" the woman replied in the Common Tongue. \"From the sea. Beyond the \\nsea. The Seven Lands, he said. Sunset Lands. Where men are iron and dragons rule. He taught me this \\nspeech.\" \\n\"A maester in Asshai,\" Ser Jorah mused. \"Tell me, Godswife, what did this Marwyn wear about his \\nneck?\" \\n\"A chain so tight it was like to choke him, Iron Lord, with links of many metals.\" \\nThe knight looked at Dany. \"Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown wears such a chain,\" he said, \\n\"and such men do know much of healing.\" \\n\"Why should you want to help my khal?\" \\n\"All men are one flock, or so we are taught,\" replied Mirri Maz Duur. \"The Great Shepherd sent me to \\nearth to heal his lambs, wherever I might find them.\" \\nQotho gave her a stinging slap. \"We are no sheep, maegi.\" \\n\"Stop it,\" Dany said angrily. \"She is mine. I will not have her harmed.\" \\nKhal Drogo grunted. \"The arrow must come out, Qotho.\" \\n\"Yes, Great Rider,\" Mirri Maz Duur answered, touching her bruised face. \"And your breast must be \\nwashed and sewn, lest the wound fester.\" \\n\"Do it, then,\" Kbal Drogo commanded. \\n\"Great Rider,\" the woman said, \"my tools and potions are inside the god\\'s house, where the healing \\npowers are strongest.\" \\n\"I will carry you, blood of my blood,\" Haggo offered. \\nPage 449\\n\\nKhal Drogo waved him away. \"I need no man\\'s help,\" he said, in a voice proud and hard. He stood, \\nunaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood ran down his breast, from where Ogo\\'s arakh \\nhad cut off his nipple. Dany moved quickly to his side. \"I am no man,\" she whispered, \"so you may lean \\non me.\" Drogo put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as they walked toward the \\ngreat mud temple. The three bloodriders followed. Dany commanded Ser Jorah and the warriors of her \\nkhas to guard the entrance and make certain no one set the building afire while they were still inside. \\nThey passed through a series of anterooms, into the high central chamber under the onion. Faint light \\nshone down through hidden windows above. A few torches burnt smokily from sconces on the walls. \\nSheepskins were scattered across the mud floor. \"There,\" Mirri Maz Duur said, pointing to the altar, a \\nmassive blue-veined stone carved with images of shepherds and their flocks. Khal Drogo lay upon it. The \\nold woman threw a handful of dried leaves onto a brazier, filling the chamber with fragrant smoke. \"Best \\nif you wait outside,\" she told the rest of them. \\n\"We are blood of his blood,\" Cohollo said. \"Here we wait.\" \\nQotho stepped close to Mirri Maz Duur. \"Know this, wife of the Lamb God. Harm the khal and you \\nsuffer the same.\" He drew his skinning knife and showed her the blade. \\n\"She will do no harm.\" Dany felt she could trust this old, plainfaced woman with her flat nose; she had \\nsaved her from the hard hands of her rapers, after all. \\n\"If you must stay, then help,\" Mirri told the bloodriders. \"The Great Rider is too strong for me. Hold him \\nstill while I draw the arrow from his flesh.\" She let the rags of her gown fall to her waist as she opened a \\ncarved chest, and busied herself with bottles and boxes, knives and needles. When she was ready, she \\nbroke off the barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft, chanting in the singsong tongue of the \\nLhazareen. She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured it over his wounds. Khal \\nDrogo cursed her, but he did not move. She bound the arrow wound with a plaster of wet leaves and \\nturned to the gash on his breast, smearing it with a pale green paste \\nbefore she pulled the flap of skin back in place. The khal ground his teeth together and swallowed a \\nscream. The godswife took out a silver needle and a bobbin of silk thread and began to close the flesh. \\nWhen she was done she painted the skin with red ointment, covered it with more leaves, and bound the \\nbreast in a ragged piece of lambskin. \"You must say the prayers I give you and keep the lambskin in \\nplace for ten days and ten nights,\" she said. \"There will be fever, and itching, and a great scar when the \\nhealing is done.\" \\nKhal Drogo sat, bells ringing. \"I sing of my scars, sheep woman.\" He flexed his arm and scowled. \\n\"Drink neither wine nor the milk of the poppy,\" she cautioned him. \"Pain you will have, but you must \\nkeep your body strong to fight the poison spirits.\" \\n\"I am khal,\" Drogo said. \"I spit on pain and drink what I like. Cohollo, bring my vest.\" The older man \\nhastened off. \\n\"Before,\" Dany said to the ugly Lhazareen woman, \"I heard you speak of birthing songs . . .\" \\n\"I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a babe,\" Mirri Maz Duur \\nreplied. \\nPage 450\\n\\n\"My time is near,\" Dany said. \"I would have you attend me when he comes, if you would.\" \\nKhal Drogo laughed. \"Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell her. She will do as you \\ncommand.\" He jumped down from the altar. \"Come, my blood. The stallions call, this place is ashes. It is \\ntime to ride.\" \\nHaggo followed the khal from the temple, but Qotho lingered long enough to favor Mirri Maz Duur with \\na stare. \"Remember, maegi, as the khal fares, so shall you.\" \\n\"As you say, rider,\" the woman answered him, gathering up her jars and bottles. \"The Great Shepherd \\nguards the flock.\" \\nTYRION \\n0n a hill overlooking the kingsroad, a long trestle table of rough-hewn pine had been erected beneath an \\nelm tree and covered with a golden cloth. There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took his evening meal \\nwith his chief knights and lords bannermen, his great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead from a \\nlofty pike. \\nTyrion arrived late, saddlesore, and sour, all too vividly aware of how amusing he must look as he \\nwaddled up the slope to his father. The day\\'s march had been long and tiring. He thought he might get \\nquite drunk tonight. It was twilight, and the air was alive with drifting fireflies. \\nThe cooks were serving the meat course: five suckling pigs, skin seared and crackling, a different fruit in \\nevery mouth. The smell made his mouth water. \"My pardons,\" he began, taking his place on the bench \\nbeside his uncle. \\n\"Perhaps I\\'d best charge you with burying our dead, Tyrion,\" Lord Tywin said. \"If you are as late to \\nbattle as you are to table, the fighting will all be done by the time you arrive.\" \\n\"Oh, surely you can save me a peasant or two, Father,\" Tyrion replied. \"Not too many, I wouldn\\'t want \\nto be greedy.\" He filled his wine cup and watched a serving man carve into the pig. The crisp skin \\ncrackled under his knife, and hot juice ran from the meat. It was the loveliest sight Tyrion had seen in \\nages. \\n\"Ser Addam\\'s outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins,\" his father reported as his \\ntrencher was filled with slices of pork. \"Lord Frey\\'s levies have joined them. They are likely no more than \\na day\\'s march north of us.\" \\n\"Please, Father,\" Tyrion said. \"I\\'m about to eat.\" \\n\"Does the thought of facing the Stark boy unman you, Tyrion? Your brother Jaime would be eager to \\ncome to grips with him.\" \\n\"I\\'d sooner come to grips with that pig. Robb Stark is not half so tender, and he never smelled as good.\" \\nPage 451\\n\\nLord Lefford, the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies, leaned forward. \"I hope your \\nsavages do not share your reluctance, else we\\'ve wasted our good steel on them.\" \\n\"My savages will put your steel to excellent use, my lord,\" Tyrion replied. When he had told Lefford he \\nneeded arms and armor to equip the three hundred men Ulf had fetched down out of the foothills, you \\nwould have thought he\\'d asked the man to turn his virgin daughters over to their pleasure. \\nLord Lefford frowned. \"I saw that great hairy one today, the one who insisted that he must have two \\nbattle-axes, the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades.\" \\n\"Shagga likes to kill with either hand,\" Tyrion said as a trencher of steaming pork was laid in front of him. \\n\"He still had that wood-axe of his strapped to his back.\" \\n\"Shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two.\" Tyrion reached a thumb and \\nforefinger into the salt dish, and sprinkled a healthy pinch over his meat. \\nSer Kevan leaned forward. \"We had a thought to put you and your wildlings in the vanguard when we \\ncome to battle.\" \\nSer Kevan seldom \"had a thought\" that Lord Tywin had not had first. Tyrion had skewered a chunk of \\nmeat on the point of his dagger and brought it to his mouth. Now he lowered it. \"The vanguard?\" he \\nrepeated dubiously. Either his lord father had a new respect for Tyrion\\'s abilities, or he\\'d decided to rid \\nhimself of his embarrassing get for good. Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he knew which. \\n\"They seem ferocious enough,\" Ser Kevan said. \\n\"Ferocious?\" Tyrion realized he was echoing his uncle like a trained bird. His father watched, judging \\nhim, weighing every word. \"Let me tell you how ferocious they are. Last night, a Moon Brother stabbed \\na Stone Crow over a sausage. So today as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and \\nopened his throat for him. Perhaps they \\nwere hoping to get the sausage back, I couldn\\'t say. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off \\nthe dead man\\'s cock, which was fortunate, but even so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and \\nShagga refuse to pay.\" \\n\"When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander,\" his father said. \\nHis brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly, and die for him if need be. \\nTyrion lacked that gift. He bought loyalty with gold, and compelled obedience with his name. \"A bigger \\nman would be able to put the fear in them, is that what you\\'re saying, my lord?\" \\nLord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother. \"If my son\\'s men will not obey his commands, perhaps the \\nvanguard is not the place for him. No doubt he would be more comfortable in the rear, guarding our \\nbaggage train.\" \\n\"Do me no kindnesses, Father,\" he said angrily. \"If you have no other command to offer me, I\\'ll lead \\nyour van.\" \\nPage 452\\n\\nLord Tywin studied his dwarf son. \"I said nothing about command. You will serve under Ser Gregor.\" \\nTyrion took one bite of pork, chewed a moment, and spit it out angrily. \"I find I am not hungry after all,\" \\nhe said, climbing awkwardly off the bench. \"Pray excuse me, my lords.\" \\nLord Tywin inclined his head, dismissing him. Tyrion turned and walked away. He was conscious of \\ntheir eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill. A great gust of laughter went up from behind him, but \\nhe did not look back. He hoped they all choked on their suckling pigs. \\nDusk had settled, turning all the banners black. The Lannister camp sprawled for miles between the river \\nand the kingsroad. In amongst the men and the horses and the trees, it was easy to get lost, and `I~rion \\ndid. He passed a dozen great pavilions and a hundred cookfires. Fireflies drifted amongst the tents like \\nwandering stars. He caught the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory, so tempting it made his empty \\nstomach growl. Away in the distance, he heard voices raised in some bawdy song. A giggling woman \\nraced past him, naked beneath a dark cloak, her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots. Farther on, \\ntwo spearmen faced each other across a little trickle of a stream, practicing their thrust- and-parry in the \\nfading light, their chests bare and slick with sweat. \\nNo one looked at him. No one spoke to him. No one paid him any mind. He was surrounded by men \\nsworn to House Lannister, a vast host twenty thousand strong, and yet he was alone. \\nWhen he heard the deep rumble of Shagga\\'s laughter booming \\nthrough the dark, he followed it to the Stone Crows in their small corner of the night. Conn son of Coratt \\nwaved a tankard of ale. \"Tyrion Halftnan! Come, sit by our fire, share meat with the Stone Crows. We \\nhave an ox.\" \\n\"I can see that, Conn son of Coratt.\" The huge red carcass was suspended over a roaring fire, skewered \\non a spit the size of a small tree. No doubt it was a small tree. Blood and grease dripped down into the \\nflames as two Stone Crows turned the meat. \"I thank you. Send for me when the ox is cooked.\" From \\nthe look of it, that might even be before the battle. He walked on. \\nEach clan had its own cookfire; Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows, Stone Crows did not eat with \\nMoon Brothers, and no one ate with Burned Men. The modest tent he had coaxed out of Lord Lefford\\'s \\nstores had been erected in the center of the four fires. Tyrion found Bronn sharing a skin of wine with the \\nnew servants. Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs, and even \\ninsisted he take a squire. They were seated around the embers of a small cookfire. A girl was with them; \\nslim, dark-haired, no more than eighteen by the look of her. Tyrion studied her face for a moment, before \\nhe spied fishbones in the ashes. \"What did you eat?\" \\n\"Trout, m\\'lord,\" said his groom. \"Bronn caught them.\" \\nTrout, he thought. Suckling pig. Damn my father. He stared mournfully at the bones, his belly rumbling. \\nHis squire, a boy with the unfortunate name of Podrick Payne, swallowed whatever he had been about \\nto say. The lad was a distant cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne, the king\\'s headsman . . . and almost as quiet, \\nalthough not for want of a tongue. Tyrion had made him stick it out once, just to be certain. \"Definitely a \\ntongue,\" he had said. \"Someday you must learn to use it.\" \\nPage 453\\n\\nAt the moment, he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of the lad, whom he \\nsuspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape. Tyrion turned his attention back to the girl. \"Is this \\nher?\" he asked Bronn. \\nShe rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet or more. \"It is, m\\'lord, and \\nshe can speak for herself, if it please you.\" \\nHe cocked his head to one side. \"I am Tyrion, of House Lannister. Men call me the Imp.\" \\n\"My mother named me Shae. Men call me . . . often.\" \\nBronn laughed, and Tyrion had to smile. \"Into the tent, Shae, if you would be so kind.\" He lifted the flap \\nand held it for her. Inside, he knelt to light a candle. \\nThe life of a soldier was not without certain compensations. Wherever you have a camp, you are certain \\nto have camp followers. At the end of the day\\'s march, Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely \\nwhore. \"I would prefer one who is reasonably young, with as pretty a face as you can find,\" he had said. \\n\"If she has washed sometime this year, I shall be glad. If she hasn\\'t, wash her. Be certain that you tell her \\nwho I am, and warn her of what I am.\" Jyck had not always troubled to do that. There was a look the \\ngirls got in their eyes sometimes when they first beheld the lordling they\\'d been hired to pleasure . . . a \\ntook that Tyrion Lannister did not ever care to see again. \\nHe lifted the candle and looked her over. Bronn had done well enough; she was doe-eyed and slim, with \\nsmall firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, insolent, and wicked. He liked that. \"Shall I take my \\ngown off, m\\'lord?\" she asked. \\n\"In good time. Are you a maiden, Shae?\" \\n\"If it please you, m\\'lord,\" she said demurely. \\n\"What would please me would be the truth of you, girl.\" \\n\"Aye, but that will cost you double.\" \\nTyrion decided they would get along splendidly. \"I am a Lannister. Gold I have in plenty, and you\\'ll find \\nme generous . . . but I\\'ll want more from you than what you\\'ve got between your legs, though I\\'ll want \\nthat too. You\\'ll share my tent, pour my wine, laugh at my jests, rub the ache from my legs after each day\\'s \\nride . . . and whether I keep you a day or a year, for so long as we are together you will take no other \\nmen into your bed.\" \\n\"Fair enough.\" She reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and pulled it up over her head \\nin one smooth motion, tossing it aside. There was nothing underneath but Shae. \"If he don\\'t put down that \\ncandle, m1ord will burn his fingers.\" \\nTyrion put down the candle, took her hand in his, and pulled her gently to him. She bent to kiss him. Her \\nmouth tasted of honey and cloves, and her fingers were deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of \\nhis clothes. \\nPage 454\\n\\nWhen he entered her, she welcomed him with whispered endearments and small, shuddering gasps of \\npleasure. Tyrion suspected her delight was feigned, but she did it so well that it did not matter. That much \\ntruth he did not crave. \\nHe had needed her, Tyrion realized afterward, as she lay quietly in his arms. Her or someone like her. It \\nhad been nigh on a year since he\\'d lain with a woman, since before he had set out for Winterfell in \\ncompany with his brother and King Robert. He could well die on the morrow or the day after, and if he \\ndid, he would sooner go to his grave \\nthinking of Shae than of his lord father, Lysa Arryn, or the Lady Catelyn Stark. \\nHe could feel the softness of her breasts pressed against his arm as she lay beside him. That was a good \\nfeeling. A song filled his head. Softly, quietly, he began to whistle. \\n\"What\\'s that, m\\'lord?\" Shae murmured against him. \\n\"Nothing,\" he told her. \"A song I learned as a boy, that\\'s all. Go to sleep, sweetling.\" \\nWhen her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out from beneath her, gently, \\nso as not to disturb her sleep. Naked, he crawled outside, stepped over his squire, and walked around \\nbehind his tent to make water. \\nBronn was seated cross-legged under a chestnut tree, near where they\\'d tied the horses. He was honing \\nthe edge of his sword, wide awake; the sellsword did not seem to sleep like other men. \"Where did you \\nfind her?\" Tyrion asked him as he pissed. \\n\"I took her from a knight. The man was loath to give her up, but your name changed his thinking \\nsomewhat . . . that, and my dirk at his throat.\" \\n\"Splendid,\" Tyrion said dryly, shaking off the last drops. \"I seem to recall saying find me a whore, not \\nmake me an enemy.\" \\n\"The pretty ones were all claimed,\" Bronn said. \"I\\'ll be pleased to take her back if you\\'d prefer a \\ntoothless drab.\" \\nTyrion limped closer to where he sat. \"My lord father would call that insolence, and send you to the \\nmines for impertinence.\" \\n\"Good for me you\\'re not your father,\" Bronn replied. \"I saw one with boils all over her nose. Would you \\nlike her?\" \\n\"What, and break your heart?\" Tyrion shot back. \"I shall keep Shae. Did you perchance note the name \\nof this knight you took her from? I\\'d rather not have him beside me in the battle.\" \\nBronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning his sword in his hand. \"You\\'ll have me beside you in the \\nbattle, dwarf.\" \\nTyrion nodded. The night air was warm on his bare skin. \"See that I survive this battle, and you can \\nname your reward.\" \\nPage 455\\n\\nBronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left, and tried a cut. \"Who\\'d want to kill the likes \\nof you?\" \\n\"My lord father, for one. He\\'s put me in the van.\" \\n\"I\\'d do the same. A small man with a big shield. You\\'ll give the archers fits.\" \\n\"I find you oddly cheering,\" Tyrion said. \"I must be mad.\" \\nBronn sheathed his sword. \"Beyond a doubt.\" \\nWhen Tyrion returned to his tent, Shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured sleepily, \"I woke and \\nm\\'lord was gone.\" \\n\"M\\'Iord is back now.\" He slid in beside her. \\nHer hand went between his stunted legs, and found him hard. \"Yes he is,\" she whispered, stroking him. \\nHe asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and she named the minor retainer of an \\ninsignificant lordling. \"You need not fear his like, m\\'lord,\" the girl said, her fingers busy at his cock. \"He is \\na small man.\" \\n\"And what am 1, pray?\" Tyrion asked her. \"A giant?\" \\n\"Oh, yes,\" she purred, \"my giant of Lannister.\" She mounted him then, and for a time, she almost made \\nhim believe it. Tyrion went to sleep smiling . . . \\n* \\' * and woke in darkness to the blare of trumpets. Shae was shaking him by the shoulder. \"M\\'Iord,\" \\nshe whispered. \"Wake up, m\\'lord. I\\'m frightened.\" \\nGroggy, he sat up and threw back the blanket. The horns called through the night, wild and urgent, a cry \\nthat said huny huny huny. He heard shouts, the clatter of spears, the whicker of horses, though nothing \\nyet that spoke to him of fighting. \"My lord father\\'s trumpets,\" he said. \"Battle assembly. I thought Stark \\nwas yet a day\\'s march away.\" \\nShae shook her head, lost. Her eyes were wide and white. \\nGroaning, Tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside, shouting for his squire. Wisps of pale \\nfog drifted through the night, long white fingers off the river. Men and horses blundered through the \\npredawn chill; saddles were being cinched, wagons loaded, fires extinguished. The trumpets blew again: \\nhuny huny huny. Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their sword belts as \\nthey ran. When he found Pod, the boy was snoring softly. Tyrion gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with \\nhis toe. \"My armor,\" he said, \"and be quick about it.\" Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already \\narmored and ahorse, wearing his battered halfhelm. \"Do you know what\\'s happened?\" Tyrion asked him. \\n\"The Stark boy stole a march on us,\" Bronn said. \"He crept down the kingsroad in the night, and now his \\nhost is less than a mile north of here, forming up in battle array.\" \\nPage 456\\n\\nHuny, the trumpets called, huny huny huny. \\n\"See that the clansmen are ready to ride.\" Tyrion ducked back inside his tent. \"Where are my clothes?\" \\nhe barked at Shae. \"There. No, the leather, damn it. Yes. Bring me my boots.\" \\nBy the time he was dressed, his squire had laid out his armor, such that it was. Tyrion owned a fine suit \\nof heavy plate, expertly crafted to \\nfit his misshapen body. Alas, it was safe at Casterly Rock, and he was not. He had to make do with \\noddments assembled from Lord Lefford\\'s wagons: mail hauberk and coif, a dead knight\\'s gorget, \\nlobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots. Some of it was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it \\nmatched, or fit as it should. His breastplate was meant for a bigger man; for his oversize head, they found \\na huge bucket-shaped greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike. \\nShae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps. \"If I die, weep for me,\" Tyrion told the whore. \\n\"How will you know? You\\'ll be dead.\" \\n\"I\\'ll know.\" \\n\"I believe you would.\" Shae lowered the greathelm down over his head, and Pod fastened it to his \\ngorget. Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the weight of shortsword and dirk. By then his groom had \\nbrought up his mount, a formidable brown courser armored as heavily as he was. He needed help to \\nmount; he felt as though he weighed a thousand stone. Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab of \\nheavy ironwood banded with steel. Lastly they gave him his battle-axe. Shae stepped back and looked \\nhim over. \"NI\\'lord looks fearsome.\" \\n\"NI\\'lord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor,\" Tyrion answered sourly, \"but I thank you for the kindness. \\nPodrick, should the battle go against us, see the lady safely home.\" He saluted her with his axe, wheeled \\nhis horse about, and trotted off. His stomach was a hard knot, so tight it pained him. Behind, his servants \\nhurriedly began to strike his tent. Pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays of the sun \\nbroke over the horizon. The western sky was a deep purple, speckled with stars. Tyrion wondered \\nwhether this was the last sunrise he would ever see . . . and whether wondering was a mark of \\ncowardice. Did his brother Jaime ever contemplate death before a battle? \\nA warhorn sounded in the far distance, a deep mournful note that chilled the soul. The clansmen climbed \\nonto their scrawny mountain horses, shouting curses and rude jokes. Several appeared to be drunk. The \\nrising sun was burning off the drifting tendrils of fog as Tyrion led them off. What grass the horses had left \\nwas heavy with dew, as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the earth. The \\nmountain men fell in behind him, each clan arrayed behind its own leaders. \\nIn the dawn light, the army of Lord Tywin Lannister unfolded like an iron rose, thorns gleaming. \\nHis uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad. Quivers \\nhanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines, to east and west of the \\nroad, \\nPage 457\\n\\nand stood calmly stringing their bows. Between them, pikemen formed squares; behind were rank on \\nrank of men-at-arms with spear and sword and axe. Three hundred heavy horse surrounded Ser Kevan \\nand the lords bannermen Lefford, Lydden, and Serrett with all their sworn retainers. \\nThe right wing was all cavalry, some four thousand men, heavy with the weight of their armor. More than \\nthree quarters of the knights were there, massed together like a great steel fist. Ser Addam Marbrand \\nhad the command. Tyrion saw his banner unfurl as his standardbearer shook it out; a burning tree, orange \\nand smoke. Behind him flew Ser Flement\\'s purple unicorn, the brindled boar of Crakehall, the bantam \\nrooster of Swyft, and more. \\nHis lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept. Around him, the reserve assembled; a huge \\nforce, half mounted and half foot, five thousand strong. Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the \\nreserve; he would take the high ground and watch the battle unfold below him, committing his forces \\nwhen and where they were needed most. \\nEven from afar, his lord father was resplendent. Tywin Lannister\\'s battle armor put his son Jaime\\'s gilded \\nsuit to shame. His greatcloak was sewn from countless layers of cloth-of-gold, so heavy that it barely \\nstirred even when he charged, so large that its drape covered most of his stallion\\'s hindquarters when he \\ntook the saddle. No ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight, so the greatcloak was held in place \\nby a matched pair of miniature lionesses crouching on his shoulders, as if poised to spring. Their mate, a \\nmale with a magnificent mane, reclined atop Lord Tywin\\'s greathelm, one paw raking the air as he \\nroared. All three lions were wrought in gold, with ruby eyes. His armor was heavy steel plate, enameled \\nin a dark crimson, greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold scrollwork. His rondels were golden \\nsunbursts, all his fastenings were gilded, and the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone \\nlike fire in the light of the rising sun. \\nTyrion could hear the rumble of the foemen\\'s drums now. He remembered Robb Stark as he had last \\nseen him, in his father\\'s high seat in the Great Hall of Winterfell, a sword naked and shining in his hands. \\nHe remembered how the direwolves had come at him out of the shadows, and suddenly he could see \\nthem again, snarling and snapping, teeth bared in his face. Would the boy bring his wolves to war with \\nhim? The thought made him uneasy. \\nThe northerners would be exhausted after their long sleepless march. Tyrion wondered what the boy had \\nbeen thinking. Did he think \\nto take them unawares while they slept? Small chance of that; whatever else might be said of him, Tywin \\nLannister was no man\\'s fool. \\nThe van was massing on the left. He saw the standard first, three black dogs on a yellow field. Ser \\nGregor sat beneath it, mounted on the biggest horse Tyrion had ever seen. Bronn took one look at him \\nand grinned. \"Always follow a big man into battle.\" \\nTyrion threw him a hard look. \"And why is that?\" \\n\"They make such splendid targets. That one, he\\'ll draw the eyes of every bowman on the field.\" \\nLaughing, Tyrion regarded the Mountain with fresh eyes. \"I confess, I had not considered it in that light.\" \\nClegane had no splendor about him; his armor was steel plate, dull grey, scarred by hard use and \\nPage 458\\n\\nshowing neither sigil nor ornament. He was pointing men into position with his blade, a two-handed \\ngreatsword that Ser Gregor waved about with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger. \"Any man \\nruns, I\\'ll cut him down myself,\" he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion. \"Imp! Take the left. Hold \\nthe river. If you can.\" \\nThe left of the left. To turn their flank, the Starks would need horses that could run on water. Tyrion led \\nhis men toward the riverbank. \"Look,\" he shouted, pointing with his axe. \"The river.\" A blanket of pale \\nmist still clung to the surface of the water, the murky green current swirling past underneath. The shallows \\nwere muddy and choked with reeds. \"That river is ours. Whatever happens, keep close to the water. \\nNever lose sight of it. Let no enemy come between us and our river. If they dirty our waters, hack off \\ntheir cocks and feed them to the fishes.\" \\nShagga had an axe in either hand. He smashed them together and made them ring. \"Halfman!\" he \\nshouted. Other Stone Crows picked up the cry, and the Black Ears and Moon Brothers as well. The \\nBurned Men did not shout, but they rattled their swords and spears. \"Halfman! Ha Ifm a n! Ha 1fm a n! \" \\nTyrion turned his courser in a circle to look over the field. The ground was rolling and uneven here; soft \\nand muddy near the river, rising in a gentle slope toward the kingsroad, stony and broken beyond it, to \\nthe cast. A few trees spotted the hillsides, but most of the land had been cleared and planted. His heart \\npounded in his chest in time to the drums, and under his layers of leather and steel his brow was cold with \\nsweat. He watched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the line, shouting and gesticulating. \\nThis wing too was all cavalry, but where the right was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers, the \\nvanguard was made up of the sweepings of the west: mounted archers \\nin leather jerkins, a swarming mass of undisciplined freeriders and sellswords, fieldhands on plow horses \\narmed with scythes and their fathers\\' rusted swords, half-trained boys from the stews of Lannisport and \\nTyrion and his mountain clansmen. \\nCrow food,\" Bronn muttered beside him, giving voice to what Tyrion had left unsaid. He could only nod. \\nHad his lord father taken leave of his senses? No pikes, too few bowmen, a bare handful of knights, the \\nill-armed and unarmored, commanded by an unthinking brute who led with his rage . . . how could his \\nfather expect this travesty of a battle to hold his left? \\nHe had no time to think about it. The drums were so near that the beat crept under his skin and set his \\nhands to twitching. Bronn drew his longsword, and suddenly the enemy was there before them, boiling \\nover the tops of the hills, advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes. \\nGods be damned, look at them all, Tyrion thought, though he knew his father had more men on the field. \\nTheir captains led them on armored warhorses, standard-bearers riding alongside with their banners. He \\nglimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods, the Karstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn\\'s battle-axe, and the \\nmailed fist of the Glovers . . . and the twin towers of Frey, blue on grey. So much for his father\\'s certainty \\nthat Lord Walder would not bestir himself. The white of House Stark was seen everywhere, the grey \\ndirewolves seeming to run and leap as the banners swirled and streamed from the high staffs. \"ere is the \\nboy? Tyrion wondered. \\nA warhorn blew. Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo, it cried, its voice as long and low and chilling as a \\ncold wind from the north. The Lannister trumpets answered, da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAAAA, \\nbrazen and defiant, yet it seemed to Tyrion that they sounded somehow smaller, more anxious. He could \\nfeel a fluttering in his bowels, a queasy liquid feeling; he hoped he was not going to die sick. \\nPage 459\\n\\nAs the horns died away, a hissing filled the air; a vast flight of arrows arched up from his right, where the \\narchers stood flanking the road. The northerners broke into a run, shouting as they came, but the \\nLannister arrows fell on them like hail, hundreds of arrows, thousands, and shouts turned to screams as \\nmen stumbled and went down. By then a second flight was in the air, and the archers were fitting a third \\narrow to their bowstrings. \\nThe trumpets blared again, da-DAAA da-DAAA da-DA da-DA daDAAAAAAA. Ser Gregor waved \\nhis huge sword and bellowed a command, and a thousand other voices screamed back at him. Tyrion put \\nhis spurs to his horse and added one more voice to the cacophony, and \\nthe van surged forward. \"The river!\" he shouted at his clansmen as they rode. \"Remember, hew to the \\nriver.\" He was still leading when they broke a canter, until Chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and \\ngalloped past him, and Shagga howled and followed. The clansmen charged after them, leaving Tyrion in \\ntheir dust. \\nA crescent of enemy spearmen had formed ahead, a double hedgehog bristling with steel, waiting behind \\ntall oaken shields marked with the sunburst of Karstark. Gregor Clegane was the first to reach them, \\nleading a wedge of armored veterans. Half the horses shied at the last second, breaking their charge \\nbefore the row of spears. The others died, sharp steel points ripping through their chests. Tyrion saw a \\ndozen men go down. The Mountain\\'s stallion reared, lashing out with iron-shod hooves as a barbed \\nspearhead raked across his neck. Maddened, the beast lunged into the ranks. Spears thrust at him from \\nevery side, but the shield wall broke beneath his weight. The northerners stumbled away from the \\nanimal\\'s death throes. As his horse fell, snorting blood and biting with his last red breath, the Mountain \\nrose untouched, laying about him with his two-handed greatsword. \\nShagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close, other Stone Crows hard behind \\nhim. Tyrion shouted, \"Burned Men! Moon Brothers! After me!\" but most of them were ahead of him. He \\nglimpsed Timett son of Timett vault free as his mount died under him in full stride, saw a Moon Brother \\nimpaled on a Karstark spear, watched Conn\\'s horse shatter a man\\'s ribs with a kick. A flight of arrows \\ndescended on them; where they came from he could not say, but they fell on Stark and Lannister alike, \\nrattling off armor or finding flesh. Tyrion lifted his shield and hid beneath it. \\nThe hedgehog was crumbling, the northerners reeling back under the impact of the mounted assault. \\nTyrion saw Shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the fool came on at a run, saw his axe shear \\nthrough mail and leather and muscle and lungs. The man was dead on his feet, the axehead lodged in his \\nbreast, yet Shagga rode on, cleaving a shield in two with his left-hand battle-axe while the corpse was \\nbouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on his right. Finally the dead man slid off. Shagga smashed the \\ntwo axes together and roared. \\nBy then the enemy was on him, and Tyrion\\'s battle shrunk to the few feet of ground around his horse. A \\nman-at-arms thrust at his chest and his axe lashed out, knocking the spear aside. The man danced back \\nfor another try, but Tyrion spurred his horse and rode right over him. Bronn was surrounded by three \\nfoes, but he lopped the head off the first spear that came at him, and raked his blade across a second \\nman\\'s face on his backslash. \\nA thrown spear came hurtling at Tyrion from the left and lodged in his shield with a woody chunk. He \\nPage 460\\n\\nwheeled and raced after the thrower, but the man raised his own shield over his head. Tyrion circled \\naround him, raining axe blows down on the wood. Chips of oak went flying, until the northerner lost his \\nfeet and slipped, failing flat on his back with his shield on top of him. He was below the reach of Tyrion\\'s \\naxe and it was too much bother to dismount, so he left him there and rode after another man, taking him \\nfrom behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt of impact up his arm. That won him a moment\\'s \\nrespite. Reining up, he looked for the river. There it was, off to the right. Somehow he had gotten turned \\naround. \\nA Burned Man rode past, slumped against his horse. A spear had entered his belly and come out \\nthrough his back. He was past any help, but when Tyrion saw one of the northerners run up and make a \\ngrab for his reins, he charged. \\nHis quarry met him sword in hand. He was tall and spare, wearing a long chainmail hauberk and \\ngauntlets of lobstered steel, but he\\'d lost his helm and blood ran down into his eyes from a gash across \\nhis forehead. Tyrion aimed a swipe at his face, but the tall man slammed it aside. \"Dwarf,\" he screamed. \\n\"Die.\" He turned in a circle as Tyrion rode around him, hacking at his head and shoulders. Steel rang on \\nsteel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he was. Where in the \\nseven hells was Bronn? \"Die,\" the man grunted, chopping at him savagely. Tyrion barely got his shield up \\nin time, and the wood seemed to explode inward under the force of the blow. The shattered pieces fell \\naway from his arm. \"Die!\" the swordsman bellowed, shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the \\ntemple so hard his head rang. The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew it back over the \\nsteel. The tall man grinned . . . until Tyrion\\'s destrier bit, quick as a snake, laying his cheek bare to the \\nbone. Then he screamed. Tyrion buried his axe in his head. \"You die,\" he told him, and he did. \\nAs he wrenched the blade free, he heard a shout. \\'Eddard!\" a voice rang out. \"For Eddard and \\nWinterfell!\" The knight came thundering down on him, swinging the spiked ball of a morningstar around \\nhis head. Their warhorses slammed together before Tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for \\nBronn. His right elbow exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint. \\nHis axe was gone, as fast as that. He clawed for his sword, but the morningstar was circling again, \\ncoming at his face. A sickening crunch, and he was falling. He did not recall hitting the ground, but when \\nhe looked up there was only sky above him. He rolled onto his side and \\ntried to find his feet, but pain shuddered through him and the world throbbed. The knight who had felled \\nhim drew up above him. \"Tyrion the Imp,\" he boomed down. \"You are mine. Do you yield, Lannister?\" \\nYes, Tyrion thought, but the word caught in his throat. He made a croaking sound and fought his way to \\nhis knees, fumbling for a weapon. His sword, his dirk, anything . . . \\n\"Do you yield?\" The knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse. Man and horse both seemed \\nimmense. The spiked ball swung in a lazy circle. Tyrion\\'s hands were numb, his vision blurred, his \\nscabbard empty. \"Yield or die,\" the knight declared, his flail whirling faster and faster. \\nTyrion lurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse\\'s belly. The animal gave a hideous scream and \\nreared. It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower of blood and viscera poured down over Tyrion\\'s \\nface, and the horse fell like an avalanche. The next he knew, his visor was packed with mud and \\nsomething was crushing his foot. He wriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. \\n. . yield . . .\" he managed to croak faintly. \\nPage 461\\n\\n\"Yes,\" a voice moaned, thick with pain. \\nTyrion scraped the mud off his helm so he could see again. The horse had fallen away from him, onto its \\nrider. The knight\\'s leg was trapped, the arm he\\'d used to break his fall twisted at a grotesque angle. \\n\"Yield,\" he repeated. Fumbling at his belt with his good hand, he drew a sword and flung it at Tyrion\\'s \\nfeet. \"I yield, my lord.\" \\nDazed, the dwarf knelt and lifted the blade. Pain hammered through his elbow when he moved his arm. \\nThe battle seemed to have moved beyond him. No one remained on his part of the field save a large \\nnumber of corpses. Ravens were already circling and landing to feed. He saw that Ser Kevan had \\nbrought up his center in support of the van; his huge mass of pikemen had pushed the northerners back \\nagainst the hills. They were struggling on the slopes, pikes thrusting against another wall of shields, these \\noval and reinforced with iron studs. As he watched, the air filled with arrows again, and the men behind \\nthe oak wall crumbled beneath the murderous fire. \"I believe you are losing, ser,\" he told the knight under \\nthe horse. The man made no reply. \\nThe sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl, though he could scarcely lift the sword he \\nheld for the agony in his elbow. Brorm reined up and looked down on him. \\n\"Small use you turned out to be,\" Tyrion told him. \\n\"It would seem you did well enough on your own,\" Bronn answered. \"You\\'ve lost the spike off your \\nhelm, though.\" \\nTyrion groped at the top of the greathelm. The spike had snapped off clean. \"I haven\\'t lost it. I know just \\nwhere it is. Do you see my horse?\" \\nBy the time they found it, the trumpets had sounded again and Lord Tywin\\'s reserve came sweeping up \\nalong the river. Tyrion watched his father fly past, the crimson-and-gold banner of Lannister rippling over \\nhis head as he thundered across the field. Five hundred knights surrounded him, sunlight flashing off the \\npoints of their lances. The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the hammer of their \\ncharge. \\nWith his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor, Tyrion made no attempt to join the slaughter. He \\nand Bronn went looking for his men. Many he found among the dead. Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of \\ncongealing blood, his arm gone at the elbow, a dozen of his Moon Brothers sprawled around him. \\nShagga was slumped beneath a tree, riddled with arrows, Conn\\'s head in his lap. Tyrion thought they \\nwere both dead, but as he dismounted, Shagga opened his eyes and said, \"They have killed Conn son of \\nCoratt.\" Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain over his breast, where the spear thrust had \\nkilled him. When Bronn pulled Shagga to his feet, the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first \\ntime. He plucked them out one by one, cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and leather, \\nand yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh. Chella daughter of Cheyk rode \\nup as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and showed them four ears she had taken. Timett they \\ndiscovered looting the bodies of the slain with his Burned Men. Of the three hundred clansmen who had \\nridden to battle behind Tyrion Lannister, perhaps half had survived. \\nHe left the living to look after the dead, sent Bronn to take charge of his captive knight, and went alone \\nin search of his father. Lord Tywin was seated by the river, sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire \\nundid the fastenings on his breastplate. \"A fine victory,\" Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion. \"Your wild \\nPage 462\\n\\nmen fought well.\" \\nHis father\\'s eyes were on him, pale green flecked with gold, so cool they gave Tyrion a chill. \"Did that \\nsurprise you, Father?\" he asked. \"Did it upset your plans? We were supposed to be butchered, were we \\nnot?\" \\nLord Tywin drained his cup, his face expressionless. \"I put the least disciplined men on the left, yes. I \\nanticipated that they would break. Robb Stark is a green boy, more like to be brave than wise. I\\'d hoped \\nthat if he saw our left collapse, he might plunge into the gap, eager for a rout. Once he was fully \\ncommitted, Ser Kevan\\'s pikes would wheel \\nand take him in the flank, driving him into the river while I brought up the reserve.\" \\n\"And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage, yet keep me ignorant of your plans.\" \\n\"A feigned rout is less convincing,\" his father said, \"and I am not inclined to trust my plans to a man who \\nconsorts with sellswords and savages.\" \\n\"A pity my savages ruined your dance.\" Tyrion pulled off his steel gauntlet and let it fall to the ground, \\nwincing at the pain that stabbed up his arm. \\n\"The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years,\" Lord Tywin admitted, \"but a \\nvictory is a victory. You appear to be wounded.\" \\nTyrion\\'s right arm was soaked with blood. \"Good of you to notice, Father,\" he said through clenched \\nteeth. \"Might I trouble you to send for your maesters? Unless you relish the notion of having a one-armed \\ndwarf for a son . . .\" \\nAn urgent shout of \"Lord Tywin!\" turned his father\\'s head before he could reply. Tywin Lannister rose to \\nhis feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off his courser. The horse was lathered and bleeding from \\nthe mouth. Ser Addam dropped to one knee, a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders, \\narmored in burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his breastplate. \"My \\nliege, we have taken some of their commanders. Lord Cerwyn, Ser Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark, \\nfour Freys. Lord Hornwood is dead, and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us.\" \\n\"And the boy?\" Lord Tywin asked. \\nSer Addam hesitated. \"The Stark boy was not with them, my lord. They say he crossed at the Twins \\nwith the great part of his horse, riding hard for Riverrun.\" \\nA green boy, Tyrion remembered, more like to be brave than wise. He would have laughed, if he hadn\\'t \\nhurt so much. \\nCATELYN \\nThe woods were full of whispers. \\nPage 463\\n\\nMoonlight winked on the tumbling waters of the stream below as it wound its rocky way along the floor \\nof the valley. Beneath the trees, warhorses whickered softly and pawed at the moist, leafy ground, while \\nmen made nervous jests in hushed voices. Now and again, she heard the chink of spears, the faint \\nmetallic slither of chain mail, but even those sounds were muffled. \\n\"it should not be long now, my lady,\" Hallis Mollen said. He had asked for the honor of protecting her in \\nthe battle to come; it was his right, as Winterfell\\'s captain of guards, and Robb had not refused it to him. \\nShe had thirty men around her, charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to Winterfell if \\nthe fighting went against them. Robb had wanted fifty; Catelyn had insisted that ten would be enough, that \\nhe would need every sword for the fight. They made their peace at thirty, neither happy with it. \\n\"It will come when it comes,\" Catelyn told him. When it came, she knew it would mean death. Hal\\'s \\ndeath perhaps . . . or hers, or Robb\\'s. No one was safe. No life was certain. Catelyn was content to \\nwait, to listen to the whispers in the woods and the faint music of the brook, to feel the warm wind in her \\nhair. \\nShe was no stranger to waiting, after all. Her men had always made her wait. \"Watch for me, little cat,\" \\nher father would always tell her, \\nwhen he rode off to court or fair or battle. And she would, standing patiently on the battlements of \\nRiverrun as the waters of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone flowed by. He did not always come when \\nhe said he would, and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood her vigil, peering out between crenels \\nand through arrow loops until she caught a glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding, trotting \\nalong the rivershore toward the landing. \"Did you watch for me?\" he\\'d ask when he bent to bug her. \"Did \\nyou, little cat?\" \\nBrandon Stark had bid her wait as well. \"I shall not be long, my lady,\" he had vowed. \"We will be wed \\non my return.\" Yet when the day came at last, it was his brother Eddard who stood beside her in the \\nsept. \\nNed had lingered scarcely a fortnight with his new bride before he too had ridden off to war with \\npromises on his lips. At least he had left her with more than words; he had given her a son. Nine moons \\nhad waxed and waned, and Robb had been born in Riverrun while his father still warred in the south. She \\nhad brought him forth in blood and pain, not knowing whether Ned would ever see him. Her son. He had \\nbeen so small . . . \\nAnd now it was for Robb that she waited . . . for Robb, and for Jaime Lannister, the gilded knight who \\nmen said had never learned to wait at all. \"The Kingslayer is restless, and quick to anger,\" her uncle \\nBrynden had told Robb. And he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of \\nwhat he said. \\nIf Robb was frightened, he gave no sign of it. Catelyn watched her son as he moved among the men, \\ntouching one on the shoulder, sharing a jest with another, helping a third to gentle an anxious horse. His \\narmor clinked softly when he moved. Only his head was bare. Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn \\nhair, so like her own, and wondered when her son had grown so big. Fifteen, and near as tall as she was. \\nLet him grow taller, she asked the gods. Let him know sixteen, and twenty, and fifty. Let him grow as \\ntall as his father, and hold his own son in his arms. Please, please, please. As she watched him, this tall \\nyoung man with the new beard and the direwolf prowling at his heels, all she could see was the babe they \\nPage 464\\n\\nhad laid at her breast at Riverrun, so long ago. \\nThe night was warm, but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make her shiver. Where are they? she \\nwondered. Could her uncle have been wrong? So much rested on the truth of what he had told them. \\nRobb had given the Blackfish three hundred picked men, and sent them ahead to screen his march. \\n\"Jaime does not know,\" Ser Brynden said when he rode back. \"I\\'ll stake my life on that. No bird has \\nreached \\nhim, my archers have seen to that. We\\'ve seen a few of his outriders, but those that saw us did not live \\nto tell of it. He ought to have sent out more. He does not know.\" \\n\"How large is his host?\" her son asked. \\n\"Twelve thousand foot, scattered around the castle in three separate camps, with the rivers between,\" \\nher uncle said, with the craggy smile she remembered so well. \"There is no other way to besiege \\nRiverrun, yet still, that will be their undoing. Two or three thousand horse.\" \\n:\\'The Kingslayer has us three to one,\" said Galbart Glover. \\n\\'True enough,\" Ser Brynden said, \"yet there is one thing Ser Jaime lacks.\" \\n\"Yes?\" Robb asked. \\n\"Patience.\" \\nTheir host was greater than it had been when they left the Twins. Lord Jason Mallister had brought his \\npower out from Seagard to join them as they swept around the headwaters of the Blue Fork and \\ngalloped south, and others had crept forth as well, hedge knights and small lords and masterless \\nmen-at-arms who had fled north when her brother Edmure\\'s army was shattered beneath the walls of \\nRiverrun. They had driven their horses as hard as they dared to reach this place before Jaime Lannister \\nhad word of their coming, and now the hour was at hand. \\nCatelyn watched her son mount up. 01yvar Frey held his horse for him, Lord Walder\\'s son, two years \\nolder than Robb, and ten years younger and more anxious. He strapped Robb\\'s shield in place and \\nhanded up his helm. When he lowered it over the face she loved so well, a tall young knight sat on his \\ngrey stallion where her son had been. It was dark among the trees, where the moon did not reach. When \\nRobb turned his head to look at her, she could see only black inside his visor. \"I must ride down the line, \\nMother,\" he told her. \"Father says you should let the men see you before a battle.\" \\n\\'Go, then,\" she said. \"Let them see you.\" \\n\\'It will give them courage,\" Robb said. \\nAnd who will give me courage? she wondered, yet she kept her silence and made herself smile for him. \\nRobb turned the big grey stallion and walked him slowly away from her, Grey Wind shadowing his steps. \\nBehind him his battle guard formed up. When he\\'d forced Catelyn to accept her protectors, she had \\ninsisted that he be guarded as well, and the lords bannermen had agreed. Many of their sons had \\nclamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf, as they had taken to calling him. Torrhen Karstark \\nand his brother Eddard were \\nPage 465\\n\\namong his thirty, and Patrek Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, no less than \\nfive of Walder Frey\\'s vast brood, along with older men like Ser Wendel Manderly and Robin Flint. One \\nof his companions was even a woman: Dacey Mormont, Lady Maege\\'s eldest daughter and heir to Bear \\nIsland, a lanky sixfooter who had been given a morningstar at an age when most girls were given dolls. \\nSome of the other lords muttered about that, but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints. \"This is not \\nabout the honor of your houses,\" she told them. \"This is about keeping my son alive and whole.\" \\nAnd if it comes to that, she wondered, will thiny be enough? Will six thousand be enough? \\nA bird called faintly in the distance, a high sharp trill that felt like an icy hand on Catelyn\\'s neck. Another \\nbird answered; a third, a fourth. She knew their call well enough, from her years at Winterfell. Snow \\nshrikes. Sometimes you saw them in the deep of winter, when the godswood was white and still. They \\nwere northern birds. \\nThey are coming, Catelyn thought. \\n\"They\\'re coming, my lady,\" Hal Mollen whispered. He was always a man for stating the obvious. \"Gods \\nbe with us.\" \\nShe nodded as the woods grew still around them. In the quiet she could hear them, far off yet moving \\ncloser; the tread of many horses, the rattle of swords and spears and armor, the murmur of human \\nvoices, with here a laugh, and there a curse. \\nEons seemed to come and go. The sounds grew louder. She heard more laughter, a shouted command, \\nsplashing as they crossed and recrossed the little stream. A horse snorted. A man swore. And then at last \\nshe saw him . . . only for an instant, framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the \\nvalley floor, yet she knew it was him. Even at a distance, Ser Jaime Lannister was unmistakable. The \\nmoonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair, and turned his crimson cloak to black. He was \\nnot wearing a helm. \\nHe was there and he was gone again, his silvery armor obscured by the trees once more. Others came \\nbehind him, long columns of them, knights and sworn swords and freeriders, three quarters of the \\nLannister horse. \\n\"He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers,\" Ser Brynden had promised. \\n\"He has ridden out with his knights thrice already, to chase down raiders or storm a stubborn holdfast.\" \\nNodding, Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him. Ned \\nhad taught him to read maps. \"Raid him here,\" he said, pointing. \"A few hundred men, no more. Tully \\nbanners. When he comes after you, we will be waiting\"-his finger moved an inch to the left-\"here.\" \\nHere was a hush in the night, moonlight and shadows, a thick carpet of dead leaves underfoot, densely \\nwooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed, the underbrush thinning as the ground fell away. \\nHere was her son on his stallion, glancing back at her one last time and lifting his sword in salute. \\nPage 466\\n\\nHere was the call of Maege Mormont\\'s warhorn, a long low blast that rolled down the valley from the \\neast, to tell them that the last of Jaime\\'s riders had entered the trap. \\nAnd Grey Wind threw back his head and howled. \\nThe sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark, and she found herself shivering. It was a terrible \\nsound, a frightening sound, yet there was music in it too. For a second she felt something like pity for the \\nLannisters below. So this is what death sounds like, she thought. \\nHAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo came the answer from the far ridge as the Greatjon winded his \\nown horn. To east and west, the trumpets of the Mallisters and Freys blew vengeance. North, where the \\nvalley narrowed and bent like a cocked elbow, Lord Karstark\\'s warhorns added their own deep, \\nmournful voices to the dark chorus. Men were shouting and horses rearing in the stream below. \\nThe whispering wood let out its breath all at once, as the bowmen Robb had hidden in the branches of \\nthe trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the screams of men and horses. All around her, the \\nriders raised their lances, and the dirt and leaves that had buried the cruet bright points fell away to reveal \\nthe gleam of sharpened steel. \"Winte~pll!\" she heard Robb shout as the arrows sighed again. He moved \\naway from her at a trot, leading his men downhill. \\nCatelyn sat on her horse, unmoving, with Hal Mollen and her guard around her, and she waited as she \\nhad waited before, for Brandon and Ned and her father. She was high on the ridge, and the trees hid \\nmost of what was going on beneath her. A heartbeat, two, four, and suddenly it was as if she and her \\nprotectors were alone in the wood. The rest were melted away into the green. \\nYet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge, she saw the Greatjon\\'s riders emerge from the \\ndarkness beneath the trees. They were in a long line, an endless line, and as they burst from the wood \\nthere was an instant, the smallest part of a heartbeat, when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the \\npoints of their lances, as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge, wreathed in silver flame. \\nThen she blinked, and they were only men, rushing down to kill or die. \\nAfterward, she could not claim she had seen the battle. Yet she could hear, and the valley rang with \\nechoes. The crack of a broken lance, the clash of swords, the cries of \"Lannister\" and \"Winterfell\" and \\n\"Tully! Riverrun and Tully!\" When she realized there was no more to see, she closed her eyes and \\nlistened. The battle came alive around her. She heard hoofbeats, iron boots splashing in shallow water, \\nthe woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel, the hiss of arrows, the \\nthunder of drums, the terrified screaming of a thousand horses. Men shouted curses and begged for \\nmercy, and got it (or not), and lived (or died). The ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound. Once \\nshe heard Robb\\'s voice, as clear as if he\\'d been standing at her side, calling, \"To me! To me!\" And she \\nheard his direwolf, snarling and growling, heard the snap of those long teeth, the tearing of flesh, shrieks \\nof fear and pain from man and horse alike. Was there only one wolf? It was hard to be certain. \\nLittle by little, the sounds dwindled and died, until at last there was only the wolf. As a red dawn broke \\nin the east, Grey Wind began to howl again. \\nRobb came back to her on a different horse, riding a piebald gelding in the place of the grey stallion he \\nhad taken down into the valley. The wolf\\'s head on his shield was slashed half to pieces, raw wood \\nPage 467\\n\\nshowing where deep gouges had been hacked in the oak, but Robb himself seemed unhurt. Yet when he \\ncame closer, Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with blood. \\n\"You\\'re hurt,\" she said. \\nRobb lifted his hand, opened and closed his fingers. \"No,\" he said. \"This is . . . Torrhen\\'s blood, \\nperhaps, or He shook his head. \"I do not know.\" \\nA mob of men followed him up the slope, dirty and dented and grinning, with Theon and the Greatjon at \\ntheir head. Between them they dragged Ser Jaime Lannister. They threw him down in front of her horse. \\n\"The Kingslayer,\" Hal announced, unnecessarily. \\nLannister raised his head. \"Lady Stark,\" he said from his knees. Blood ran down one cheek from a gash \\nacross his scalp, but the pale light of dawn had put the glint of gold back in his hair. \"I would offer you my \\nsword, but I seem to have mislaid it.\" \\n\"It is not your sword I want, ser,\" she told him. \"Give me my father and my brother Edmure. Give me my \\ndaughters. Give me my lord husband.\" \\n\" I have mislaid them as well, I fear.\" \\n\"A pity,\" Catelyn said coldly. \\n\"Kill him, Robb,\" Theon Greyjoy urged. \"Take his head off.\" \\n\"No,\" her son answered, peeling off his bloody glove. \"He\\'s more use alive than dead. And my lord \\nfather never condoned the murder of prisoners after a battle.\" \\n\"A wise man,\" Jaime Lannister said, \"and honorable.\" \\n\"Take him away and put him in irons,\" Catelyn said. \\n\"Do as my lady mother says,\" Robb commanded, \"and make certain there\\'s a strong guard around him. \\nLord Karstark will want his head on a pike.\" \\n\"That he will,\" the Greatjon agreed, gesturing. Lannister was led away to be bandaged and chained. \\n\"Why should Lord Karstark want him dead?\" Catelyn asked. \\nRobb looked away into the woods, with the same brooding look that Ned often got. \"He . . . he killed \\nthem . . .\" \\n\"Lord Karstark\\'s sons,\" Galbart Glover explained. \\n\"Both of them,\" said Robb. \"Torrhen and Eddard. And Daryn Hornwood as well.\" \\n\"No one can fault Lannister on his courage,\" Glover said. \"When he saw that he was lost, he rallied his \\nretainers and fought his way up the valley, hoping to reach Lord Robb and cut him down. And almost \\ndid.\" \\nPage 468\\n\\n\"He mislaid his sword in Eddard Karstark\\'s neck, after he took Torrhen\\'s hand off and split Daryn \\nHornwood\\'s skull open,\" Robb said. \"All the time he was shouting for me. If they hadn\\'t tried to stop \\nhim-\" \\n\"-I should then be mourning in place of Lord Karstark,\" Catelyn said. \"Your men did what they were \\nsworn to do, Robb. They died protecting their liege lord. Grieve for them. Honor them for their valor. \\nBut not now. You have no time for grief. You may have lopped the head off the snake, but three quarters \\nof the body is still coiled around my father\\'s castle. We have won a battle, not a war.\" \\n\"But such a battle!\" said Theon Greyjoy eagerly. \"My lady, the realm has not seen such a victory since \\nthe Field of Fire. I vow, the Lannisters lost ten men for every one of ours that fell. We\\'ve taken close to a \\nhundred knights captive, and a dozen lords bannermen. Lord Westerling, Lord Banefort, Ser Garth \\nGreenfield, Lord Estren, Ser Tytos Brax, Mallor the Dornishman . . . and three Lannisters besides Jaime, \\nLord Tywin\\'s own nephews, two of his sister\\'s sons and one of his dead brother\\'s . . .\" \\n\"And Lord Tywin?\" Catelyn interrupted. \"Have you perchance taken Lord Tywin, Theon?\" \\n\"No,\" Greyjoy answered, brought up short. \\n\"Until you do, this war is far from done.\" \\nRobb raised his head and pushed his hair back out of his eyes. \"My mother is right. We still have \\nRiverrun.\" \\nDAENERYS \\nThe flies circled Khal Drogo slowly, their wings buzzing, a low thrum at the edge of hearing that filled \\nDany with dread. \\nThe sun was high and pitiless. Heat shimmered in waves off the stony outcrops of low hills. A thin finger \\nof sweat trickled slowly between Dany\\'s swollen breasts. The only sounds were the steady clop of their \\nhorses\\' hooves, the rhythmic tingle of the bells in Drogo\\'s hair, and the distant voices behind them. \\nDany watched the flies. \\nThey were as large as bees, gross, purplish, glistening. The Dothraki called them bloodflies. They lived in \\nmarshes and stagnant pools, sucked blood from man and horse alike, and laid their eggs in the dead and \\ndying. Drogo hated them. Whenever one came near him, his hand would shoot out quick as a striking \\nsnake to close around it. She had never seen him miss. He would hold the fly inside his huge fist long \\nenough to hear its frantic buzzing. Then his fingers would tighten, and when he opened his hand again, the \\nfly would be only a red smear on his palm. \\nNow one crept across the rump of his stallion, and the horse gave an angry flick of its tail to brush it \\naway. The others flitted about Drogo, closer and closer. The khal did not react. His eyes were fixed on \\ndistant brown hills, the reins loose in his hands. Beneath his painted vest, a plaster of fig leaves and caked \\nblue mud covered the wound on his \\nPage 469\\n\\nbreast. The herbwomen had made it for him. Mirri Maz Duur\\'s poultice had itched and burned, and he \\nhad torn it off six days ago, cursing her for a maegi. The mud plaster was more soothing, and the \\nherbwomen made him poppy wine as well. He\\'d been drinking it heavily these past three days; when it \\nwas not poppy wine, it was fermented mare\\'s milk or pepper beer. \\nYet he scarcely touched his food, and he thrashed and groaned in the night. Dany could see how drawn \\nhis face had become. Rhaego was restless in her belly, kicking like a stallion, yet even that did not stir \\nDrogo\\'s interest as it had. Every morning her eyes found fresh lines of pain on his face when he woke \\nfrom his troubled sleep. And now this silence. It was making her afraid. Since they had mounted up at \\ndawn, he had said not a word. When she spoke, she got no answer but a grunt, and not even that much \\nsince midday. \\nOne of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the khal\\'s shoulder. Another, circling, touched down on \\nhis neck and crept up toward his mouth. Khal Drogo swayed in the saddle, bells ringing, as his stallion \\nkept onward at a steady walking pace. \\nDany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer. \"My lord,\" she said softly. \"Drogo. My \\nsun-and-stars.\" \\nHe did not seem to hear. The bloodfly crawled up under his drooping mustache and settled on his \\ncheek, in the crease beside his nose. Dany gasped, \"Drogo. \" Clumsily she reached over and touched his \\narm. \\nKhal Drogo reeled in the saddle, tilted slowly, and fell heavily from his horse. The flies scattered for a \\nheartbeat, and then circled back to settle on him where he lay. \\n\"No,\" Dany said, reining up. Heedless of her belly for once, she scrambled off her silver and ran to him. \\nThe grass beneath him was brown and dry. Drogo cried out in pain as Dany knelt beside him. His breath \\nrattled harshly in his throat, and he looked at her without recognition. \"My horse,\" he gasped. Dany \\nbrushed the flies off his chest, smashing one as he would have. His skin burned beneath her fingers. \\nThe khal\\'s bloodriders had been following just behind them. She heard Haggo shout as they galloped up. \\nCohollo vaulted from his horse. \"Blood of my blood,\" he said as he dropped to his knees. The other two \\nkept to their mounts. \\n\"No,\" Khal Drogo groaned, struggling in Dany\\'s arms. \"Must ride. Ride. No.\" \\n\"He fell from his horse,\" Haggo said, staring down. His broad face was impassive, but his voice was \\nleaden. \\n\"You must not say that,\" Dany told him. \"We have ridden far enough today. We will camp here.\" \\n\"Here?\" Haggo looked around them. The land was brown and sere, inhospitable. \"This is no camping \\nground.\" \\n\"It is not for a woman to bid us halt,\" said Qotho, \"not even a khaleesi.\" \\nPage 470\\n\\n\"We camp here,\" Dany repeated. \"Haggo, tell them Khal Drogo commanded the halt. If any ask why, \\nsay to them that my time is near and I could not continue. Cohollo, bring up the slaves, they must put up \\nthe khal\\'s tent at once. Qotho-\" \\n\"You do not command me, Khaleesi,\" Qotho said. \\n\"Find Mirri Maz Duur,\" she told him. The godswife would be walking among the other Lamb Men, in the \\nlong column of slaves. \"Bring her to me, with her chest.\" \\nQotho glared down at her, his eyes hard as flint. \"The maegi.\" He spat. \"This I will not do.\" \\n\"You will,\" Dany said, \"or when Drogo wakes, he will hear why you defied me.\" \\nFurious, Qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger . . . but Dany knew he would return \\nwith Mirri Maz Duur, however little he might like it. The slaves erected Khal Drogo\\'s tent beneath a \\njagged outcrop of black rock whose shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun. Even \\nso, it was stifling under the sandsilk as Irri and Doreah helped Dany walk Drogo inside. Thick patterned \\ncarpets had been laid down over the ground, and pillows scattered in the corners. Eroeh, the timid girl \\nDany had rescued outside the mud walls of the Lamb Men, set up a brazier. They stretched Drogo out \\non a woven mat. \"No,\" he muttered in the Common Tongue. \"No, no.\" It was all he said, all he seemed \\ncapable of saying. \\nDoreah unhooked his medallion belt and stripped off his vest and leggings, while Jhiqui knelt by his feet \\nto undo the laces of his riding sandals. Irri wanted to leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze, but \\nDany forbade it. She would not have any see Drogo this way, indelirium and weakness. When her khas \\ncame up, she posted them outside at guard. \"Admit no one without my leave,\" she told Jhogo. \"No one.\" \\nEroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where he lay. \"He dies,\" she whispered. \\nDany slapped her. \"The khal cannot die. He is the father of the stallion who mounts the world. His hair \\nhas never been cut. He still wears the bells his father gave him.\" \\n\"Khaleesi, \" Jhiqui said, \"he fell from his horse.\" \\nTrembling, her eyes full of sudden tears, Dany turned away from them. He fell from his horse! It was so, \\nshe had seen it, and the bloodriders, and no doubt her handmaids and the men of her khas as well. And \\nhow many more? They could not keep it secret, and Dany knew what that meant. A khal who could not \\nride could not rule, and Drogo had fallen from his horse. \\n\"We must bathe him,\" she said stubbornly. She must not allow herself to despair. \"Irri, have the tub \\nbrought at once. Doreah, Eroeh, find water, cool water, he\\'s so hot.\" He was a fire in human skin. \\nThe slaves set up the heavy copper tub in the corner of the tent. When Doreah brought the first jar of \\nwater, Dany wet a length of silk to lay across Drogo\\'s brow, over the burning skin. His eyes looked at \\nher, but he did not see. When his lips opened, no words escaped them, only a moan. \"Where is Mirri \\nMaz Duur?\" she demanded, her patience rubbed raw with fear. \\n\"Ootho will find her,\" Irri said. \\nPage 471\\n\\nHer handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur, sweetening it with jars of bitter oil and \\nhandfuls of crushed mint leaves. While the bath was being prepared, Dany knelt awkwardly beside her \\nlord husband, her belly great with their child within. She undid his braid with anxious fingers, as she had \\non the night he\\'d taken her for the first time, beneath the stars. His bells she laid aside carefully, one by \\none. He would want them again when he was well, she told herself. \\nA breath of air entered the tent as Aggo poked his head through the silk. \"Khaleesi, \" he said, \"the Andal \\nis come, and begs leave to enter.\" \\n\"The Andal\" was what the Dothraki called Ser Jorah. \"Yes,\" she said, rising clumsily, \"send him in.\" She \\ntrusted the knight. He would know what to do if anyone did. \\nSer Jorah Mormont ducked through the door flap and waited a moment for his eyes to adjust to the \\ndimness. In the fierce heat of the south, he wore loose trousers of mottled sandsilk and open-toed riding \\nsandals that laced up to his knee. His scabbard hung from a twisted horsehair belt. Under a bleached \\nwhite vest, he was bare-chested, skin reddened by the sun. \"Talk goes from mouth to ear, all over the \\nkhalasar,\" he said. \"It is said Khal Drogo fell from his horse.\" \\n\"Help him,\" Dany pleaded. \"For the love you say you bear me, help him now.\" \\nThe knight knelt beside her. He looked at Drogo long and hard, and then at Dany. \"Send your maids \\naway.\" \\nWordlessly, her throat tight with fear, Dany made a gesture. Irri herded the other girls from the tent. \\nWhen they were alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy surprising in such a big man, \\nhe began to scrape away the black leaves and dried blue mud from Drogo\\'s chest. The plaster had caked \\nhard as the mud walls of the Lamb Men, and like those walls it cracked easily. Ser Jorah broke the dry \\nmud with his knife, pried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul, sweet smell \\nrose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were crusted with blood and pus, \\nDrogo\\'s breast black and glistening with corruption. \\n\"No,\" Dany whispered as tears ran down her cheeks. \"No, please, gods hear me, no.\" \\nKhal Drogo thrashed, fighting some unseen enemy. Black blood ran slow and thick from his open \\nwound. \\n\"Your khal is good as dead, Princess.\" \\n\"No, he can\\'t die, he mustn\\'t, it was only a cut.\" Dany took his large callused hand in her own small ones, \\nand held it tight between them. \"I will not let him die . . .\" \\nSer Jorah gave a bitter laugh. \"Khaleesi or queen, that command is beyond your power. Save your \\ntears, child. Weep for him tomorrow, or a year from now. We do not have time for grief. We must go, \\nand quickly, before he dies.\" \\nDany was lost. \"Go? Where should we go?\" \\nPage 472\\n\\n\"Asshai, I would say. It lies far to the south, at the end of the known world, yet men say it is a great port. \\nWe will find a ship to take us back to Pentos. It will be a hard journey, make no mistake. Do you trust \\nyour khas? Will they come with us?\" \\n\"Khal Drogo commanded them to keep me safe,\" Dany replied uncertainly, \"but if he dies . . .\" She \\ntouched the swell of her belly. \"I don\\'t understand. Why should we flee? I am khaleesi. I carry Drogo\\'s \\nheir. He will be khal after Drogo . . .\" \\nSer Jorah frowned. \"Princess, hear me. The Dothraki will not follow a suckling babe. Drogo\\'s strength \\nwas what they bowed to, and only that. When he is gone, Jhaqo and Pono and the other kos will fight for \\nhis place, and this khalasar will devour itself. The winner will want no more rivals. The boy will be taken \\nfrom your breast the moment he is born. They will give him to the dogs . . .\" \\nDany hugged herself. \"But why?\" she cried plaintively. \"Why should they kill a little baby?\" \\n\"He is Drogo\\'s son, and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the world. It was prophesied. \\nBetter to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows to manhood.\" \\nThe child kicked inside her, as if he had heard. Dany remembered \\nthe story Viserys had told her, of what the Usurper\\'s dogs had done to Rhaegar\\'s children. His son had \\nbeen a babe as well, yet they had ripped him from his mother\\'s breast and dashed his head against a wall. \\nThat was the way of men. \"They must not hurt my son!\" she cried. \"I will order my khas to keep him safe, \\nand Drogo\\'s bloodriders will-\" \\nSer Jorah held her by the shoulders. \"A bloodrider dies with his khaL You know that, child. They will \\ntake you to Vaes Dothrak, to the crones, that is the last duty they owe him in life . . . when it is done, \\nthey will join Drogo in the night lands.\" \\nDany did not want to go back to Vaes Dothrak and live the rest of her life among those terrible old \\nwomen, yet she knew that the knight spoke the truth. Drogo had been more than her sun-and-stars; he \\nhad been the shield that kept her safe. \"I will not leave him,\" she said stubbornly, miserably. She took his \\nhand again. \"I will not.\" \\nA stirring at the tent flap made Dany turn her head. MirTi Maz Duur entered, bowing low. Days on the \\nmarch, trailing behind the khalasar, had left her limping and haggard, with blistered and bleeding feet and \\nhollows under her eyes. Behind her came Ootho and Haggo, carrying the godswife\\'s chest between \\nthem. When the bloodriders caught sight of Drogo\\'s wound, the chest slipped from Haggo\\'s fingers and \\ncrashed to the floor of the tent, and Qotho swore an oath so foul it seared the air. \\nMirri Maz Duur studied Drogo, her face still and dead. \"The wound has festered.\" \\n\"This is your work, maegi,\" Ootho said. Haggo laid his fist across Mirri\\'s cheek with a meaty smack that \\ndrove her to the ground. Then he kicked her where she lay. \\n\"Stop it!\" Dany screamed. \\nQotho pulled Haggo away, saying, \"Kicks are too merciful for a maegi. Take her outside. We will stake \\nher to the earth, to be the mount of every passing man. And when they are done with her, the dogs will \\nPage 473\\n\\nuse her as well. Weasels will tear out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes. The flies off the \\nriver shall lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts . . .\" He dug iron-hard \\nfingers into the soft, wobbly flesh under the godswife\\'s arm and hauled her to her feet. \\n\"No,\" Dany said. \"I will not have her harmed.\" \\nQotho\\'s lips skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery of a smile. \"No? You say \\nme no? Better you should pray that we do not stake you out beside your maegi. You did this, as much as \\nthe other.\" \\nSer Jorah stepped between them, loosening his longsword in its scabbard. \"Rein in your tongue, \\nbloodrider. The princess is still your khaleesi. \" \\n\"Only while the blood-of-my-blood still lives,\" Qotho told the knight. \"When he dies, she is nothing.\" \\nDany felt a tightness inside her. \"Before I was khaleesi, I was the blood of the dragon. Ser Jorah, \\nsummon my khas.\" \\n\"No,\" said Qotho. \"We will go. For now . . . Khaleesi. \" Haggo followed him from the tent, scowling. \\n\"That one means you no good, Princess,\" Mormont said. \"The Dothraki say a man and his bloodriders \\nshare one life, and Qotho sees it ending. A dead man is beyond fear.\" \\n\"No one has died,\" Dany said. \"Ser Jorah, I may have need of your blade. Best go don your armor.\" \\nShe was more frightened than she dared admit, even to herself. \\nThe knight bowed. \"As you say.\" He strode from the tent. \\nDany turned back to Mirri Maz Duur. The woman\\'s eyes were wary. \"So you have saved me once \\nmore.\" \\n\"And now you must save him,\" Dany said. \"Please \\n\"You do not ask a slave,\" Mirri replied sharply, \"you tell her.\" She went to Drogo burning on his mat, \\nand gazed long at his wound. \"Ask or tell, it makes no matter. He is beyond a healer\\'s skills.\" The khal\\'s \\neyes were closed. She opened one with her fingers. \"He has been dulling the hurt with milk of the \\npoppy.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Dany admitted. \\n\"I made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and bound it in a lambskin.\" \\n\"It burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen made him a new one, wet and soothing.\" \\n\"It burned, yes. There is great healing magic in fire, even your hairless men know that.\" \\n\"Make him another poultice,\" Dany begged. \"This time I will make certain he wears it.\" \\n\"The time for that is past, my lady,\" Mirri said. \"All I can do now is ease the dark road before him, so he \\nPage 474\\n\\nmight ride painless to the night lands. He will be gone by morning.\" \\nHer words were a knife through Dany\\'s breast. What had she ever done to make the gods so cruel? She \\nhad finally found a safe place, had finally tasted love and hope. She was finally going home. And now to \\nlose it all . . . \"No,\" she pleaded. \"Save him, and I will free you, I swear it. You must know a way . . . \\nsome magic, some . . .\" \\nMirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied Daenerys \\nthrough eyes as black as night. \"There is a spell.\" Her voice was quiet, scarcely more than a whisper. \\n\"But it is hard, lady, and dark. Some would say that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and \\npaid dear for the lesson. My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.\" \\nDany went cold all over. \"Then you truly are a maegi \\n\"Am IT\\' Mirri Maz Duur smiled. \"Only a maegi can save your rider now, Silver Lady.\" \\n\"Is there no other way?\" \\n\"No other.\" \\nKhal Drogo gave a shuddering gasp. \\n\"Do it,\" Dany blurted. She must not be afraid; she was the blood of the dragon. \"Save him.\" \\n\"There is a price,\" the godswife warned her. \\n\"You\\'ll have gold, horses, whatever you like.\" \\n\"It is not a matter of gold or horses. This is bloodmagic, lady. Only death may pay for life.\" \\n\"Death?\" Dany wrapped her arms around herself protectively, rocked back and forth on her heels. \"My \\ndeath?\" She told herself she would die for him, if she must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would \\nnot be afraid. Her brother Rhaegar had died for the woman he loved. \\n\"No,\" Mirri Maz Duur promised. \"Not your death, Khaleesi.\" \\nDany trembled with relief. \"Do it.\" \\nThe maegi nodded solemnly. \"As you speak, so it shall be done. Call your servants.\" \\nKhal Drogo writhed feebly as Rakharo and Quaro lowered him into the bath. \"No,\" he muttered, \"no. \\nMust ride.\" Once in the water, all the strength seemed to leak out of him. \\n\"Bring his horse,\" Mirri Maz Duur commanded, and so it was done. Jhogo led the great red stallion into \\nthe tent. When the animal caught the scent of death, he screamed and reared, rolling his eyes. It took \\nthree men to subdue him. \\n\"What do you mean to do?\" Dany asked her. \\nPage 475\\n\\n\"We need the blood,\" Mirri answered. \"That is the way.\" \\nJhogo edged back, his hand on his arakh. He was a youth of sixteen years, whip-thin, fearless, quick to \\nlaugh, with the faint shadow of his first mustachio on his upper lip. He fell to his knees before her. \\n\"Khaleesi, \" he pleaded, \"you must not do this thing. Let me kill this maegi.\" \\n\"Kill her and you kill your khal,\" Dany said. \\n\"This is bloodmagic,\" he said. \"It is forbidden.\" \\n\" I am khaleesi, and I say it is not forbidden. In Vaes Dothrak, Khal Drogo slew a stallion and I ate his \\nheart, to give our son strength and courage. This is the same. The same.\" \\nThe stallion kicked and reared as Rakharo, Quaro, and Aggo pulled him close to the tub where the khal \\nfloated like one already dead, pus and blood seeping from his wound to stain the bathwaters. Mirri Maz \\nDuur chanted words in a tongue that Dany did not know, and a knife appeared in her hand. Dany never \\nsaw where it came from. It looked old; hammered red bronze, leaf-shaped, its blade covered with \\nancient glyphs. The maegi drew it across the stallion\\'s throat, under the noble head, and the horse \\nscreamed and shuddered as the blood poured out of him in a red rush. He would have collapsed, but the \\nmen of her khas held him up. \"Strength of the mount, go into the rider,\" Mirri sang as horse blood swirled \\ninto the waters of Drogo\\'s bath. \"Strength of the beast, go into the man.\" \\nJhogo looked terrified as he struggled with the stallion\\'s weight, afraid to touch the dead flesh, yet afraid \\nto let go as well. Only a horse, Dany thought. If she could buy Drogo\\'s life with the death of a horse, she \\nwould pay a thousand times over. \\nWhen they let the stallion fall, the bath was a dark red, and nothing showed of Drogo but his face. Mirri \\nMaz Duur had no use for the carcass. \"Burn it,\" Dany told them. It was what they did, she knew. When a \\nman died, his mount was killed and placed beneath him on the funeral pyre, to carry him to the night \\nlands. The men of her khas dragged the carcass from the tent. The blood had gone everywhere. Even the \\nsandsilk walls were spotted with red, and the rugs underfoot were black and wet. \\nBraziers were lit. Mirri Maz Duur tossed a red powder onto the coals. It gave the smoke a spicy scent, \\na pleasant enough smell, yet Eroeh fled sobbing, and Dany was filled with fear. But she had gone too far \\nto turn back now. She sent her handmaids away. \"Go with them, Silver Lady,\" Mirri Maz Duur told her. \\n\"I will stay,\" Dany said. \"The man took me under the stars and gave life to the child inside me. I will not \\nleave him.\" \\n\"You must. Once I begin to sing, no one must enter this tent. My song will wake powers old and dark. \\nThe dead will dance here this night. No living man must look on them.\" \\nDany bowed her head, helpless. \"No one will enter.\" She bent over the tub, over Drogo in his bath of \\nblood, and kissed him lightly on the brow. \"Bring him back to me,\" she whispered to Mirri Maz Duur \\nbefore she fled. \\nOutside, the sun was low on the horizon, the sky a bruised red. The \\nPage 476\\n\\nkhalasar had made camp. Tents and sleeping mats were scattered as far as the eye could see. A hot \\nwind blew. Jhogo and Aggo were digging a firepit to burn the dead stallion. A crowd had gathered to \\nstare at Dany with hard black eyes, their faces like masks of beaten copper. She saw Ser Jorah \\nMormont, wearing mail and leather now, sweat beading on his broad, balding forehead. He pushed his \\nway through the Dothraki to Dany\\'s side. When he saw the scarlet footprints her boots had left on the \\nground, the color seemed to drain from his face. \"What have you done, you little fool?\" he asked \\nhoarsely. \\n\"I had to save him.\" \\n\"We could have fled,\" he said. \"I would have seen you safe to Asshai, Princess. There was no need . . .\" \\n\"Am I truly your princess?\" she asked him. \\n\"You know you are, gods save us both.\" \\n\"Then help me now.\" \\nSer Jorah grimaced. \"Would that I knew how.\" \\nMirri Maz Duur\\'s voice rose to a high, ululating wail that sent a shiver down Dany\\'s back. Some of the \\nDothraki began to mutter and back away. The tent was aglow with the light of braziers within. Through \\nthe blood-spattered sandsilk, she glimpsed shadows moving. \\nMirri Maz Duur was dancing, and not alone. \\nDany saw naked fear on the faces of the Dothraki. \"This must not be,\" Ootho thundered. \\nShe had not seen the bloodrider return. Haggo and Cohollo were with him. They had brought the \\nhairless men, the eunuchs who healed with knife and needle and fire. \\n\"This will be,\" Dany replied. \\n\"Maegi, \" Haggo growled. And old Cohollo-Cohollo who had bound his life to Drogo\\'s on the day of his \\nbirth, Cohollo who had always been kind to her-Cohollo spat full in her face. \\n\"You will die, maegi,\" Qotho promised, \"but the other must die first.\" He drew his arakh and made for \\nthe tent. \\n\"No,\" she shouted, \"you mustn\\'t.\" She caught him by the shoulder, but Qotho shoved her aside. Dany fell \\nto her knees, crossing her arms over her belly to protect the child within. \"Stop him,\" she commanded her \\nkhas, \"kill him.\" \\nRakharo and Quaro stood beside the tent flap. Quaro took a step forward, reaching for the handle of his \\nwhip, but Qotho spun graceful as a dancer, the curved arakh rising. It caught Quaro low under the arm, \\nthe bright sharp steel biting up through leather and skin, through muscle and rib bone. Blood fountained \\nas the young rider reeled backward, gasping. \\nPage 477\\n\\nQotho wrenched the blade free. \"Horselord,\" Ser Jorah Mormont called. \"Try me.\" His longsword slid \\nfrom its scabbard. \\nQotho whirled, cursing. The arakh moved so fast that Quaro\\'s blood flew from it in a fine spray, like rain \\nin a hot wind. The longsword caught it a foot from Ser Jorah\\'s face, and held it quivering for an instant as \\nQotho howled in fury. The knight was clad in chainmail, with gauntlets and greaves of lobstered steel and \\na heavy gorget around his throat, but he had not thought to don his helm. \\nQotho danced backward, arakh whirling around his head in a shining blur, flickering out like lightning as \\nthe knight came on in a rush. Ser Jorah parried as best he could, but the slashes came so fast that it \\nseemed to Dany that Qotho had four arakhs and as many arms. She heard the crunch of sword on mail, \\nsaw sparks fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet. Suddenly it was Mormont stumbling \\nbackward, and Qotho leaping to the attack. The left side of the knight\\'s face ran red with blood, and a \\ncut to the hip opened a gash in his mail and left him limping. Qotho screamed taunts at him, calling him a \\ncraven, a milk man, a eunuch in an iron suit. \"You die now!\" he promised, arakh shivering through the red \\ntwilight. Inside Dany\\'s womb, her son kicked wildly. The curved blade slipped past the straight one and \\nbit deep into the knight\\'s hip where the mail gaped open. \\nMormont grunted, stumbled. Dany felt a sharp pain in her belly, a wetness on her thighs. Qotho shrieked \\ntriumph, but his arakh had found bone, and for half a heartbeat it caught. \\nIt was enough. Ser Jorah brought his longsword down with all the strength left him, through flesh and \\nmuscle and bone, and Qotho\\'s forearm dangled loose, flopping on a thin cord of skin and sinew. The \\nknight\\'s next cut was at the Dothraki\\'s ear, so savage that Qotho\\'s face seemed almost to explode. \\nThe Dothraki were shouting, Mirri Maz Duur wailing inside the tent like nothing human, Quaro pleading \\nfor water as he died. Dany cried out for help, but no one heard. Rakharo was fighting Haggo, arakh \\ndancing with arakh until Jhogo\\'s whip cracked, loud as thunder, the lash coiling around Haggo\\'s throat. A \\nyank, and the bloodrider stumbled backward, losing his feet and his sword. Rakharo sprang forward, \\nhowling, swinging his arakh down with both hands through the top of Haggo\\'s head. The point caught \\nbetween his eyes, red and quivering. Someone threw a stone, and when Dany looked, her shoulder was \\ntorn and bloody. \"No,\" she wept, \"no, please, stop it, it\\'s too high, the price is too high.\" More stones \\ncame flying. She tried to crawl toward the tent, but Cohollo caught her. Fingers in her hair, he pulled \\nher head back and she felt the cold touch of his knife at her throat. \"My baby,\" she screamed, and \\nperhaps the gods heard, for as quick as that, Cohollo was dead. Aggo\\'s arrow took him under the arm, \\nto pierce his lungs and heart. \\nWhen at last Daenerys found the strength to raise her head, she saw the crowd dispersing, the Dothraki \\nstealing silently back to their tents and sleeping mats. Some were saddling horses and riding off. The sun \\nhad set. Fires burned throughout the khalasar, great orange blazes that crackled with fury and spit \\nembers at the sky. She tried to rise, and agony seized her and squeezed her like a giant\\'s fist. The breath \\nwent out of her; it was all she could do to gasp. The sound of Mirri Maz Duur\\'s voice was like a funeral \\ndirge. Inside the tent, the shadows whirled. \\nAn arm went under her waist, and then Ser Jorah was lifting her off her feet. His face was sticky with \\nblood, and Dany saw that half his ear was gone. She convulsed in his arms as the pain took her again, \\nand heard the knight shouting for her handmaids to help him. Are they all so afraid? She knew the \\nPage 478\\n\\nanswer. Another pain grasped her, and Dany bit back a scream. It felt as if her son had a knife in each \\nhand, as if he were hacking at her to cut his way out. \"Doreah, curse you,\" Ser Jorah roared. \"Come \\nhere. Fetch the birthing women.\" \\n\"They will not come. They say she is accursed.\" \\n\"They\\'ll come or I\\'ll have their heads.\" \\nDoreah wept. \"They are gone, my lord.\" \\n\"The maegi,\" someone else said. Was that Aggo? \"Take her to the maegi.11 \\nNo, Dany wanted to say, no, not that, you mustn\\'t, but when she opened her mouth, a long wail of pain \\nescaped, and the sweat broke over her skin. What was wrong with them, couldn\\'t they see? Inside the \\ntent the shapes were dancing, circling the brazier and the bloody bath, dark against the sandsilk, and \\nsome did not look human. She glimpsed the shadow of a great wolf, and another like a man wreathed in \\nflames. \\n\"The Lamb Woman knows the secrets of the birthing bed,\" Irri said. \"She said so, I heard her.\" \\n\"Yes,\" Doreah agreed, \"I heard her too.\" \\nNo, she shouted, or perhaps she only thought it, for no whisper of sound escaped her lips. She was \\nbeing carried. Her eyes opened to gaze up at a flat dead sky, black and bleak and starless. Please, no. \\nThe sound of Mirri Maz Duur\\'s voice grew louder, until it filled the world. The shapes! she screamed. \\nThe dancers! \\nSer Jorah carried her inside the tent. \\nARYA \\nThe scent of hot bread drifting from the shops along the Street of Flour was sweeter than any perfume \\nArya had ever smelled. She took a deep breath and stepped closer to the pigeon. It was a plump one, \\nspeckled brown, busily pecking at a crust that had fallen between two cobblestones, but when Arya\\'s \\nshadow touched it, it took to the air. \\nHer stick sword whistled out and caught it two feet off the ground, and it went down in a flurry of brown \\nfeathers. She was on it in the blink of an eye, grabbing a wing as the pigeon flapped and fluttered. It \\npecked at her hand. She grabbed its neck and twisted until she felt the bone snap. \\nCompared with catching cats, pigeons were easy. \\nA passing septon was looking at her askance. \"Here\\'s the best place to find pigeon,\" Arya told him as \\nshe brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick sword. \"They come for the crumbs.\" He hurried \\naway. \\nShe tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street. A man was pushing a load of tarts by on a \\ntwo-wheeled cart; the smells sang of blueberries and lemons and apricots. Her stomach made a hollow \\nrumbly noise. \"Could I have one?\" she heard herself say. \"A lemon, or \\nPage 479\\n\\n. or any kind.\" \\nThe pushcart man looked her up and down. Plainly he did not like what he saw. \"Three coppers.\" \\nArya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot. \"I\\'ll trade you a fat pigeon,\" she said. \\n\"The Others take your pigeon,\" the pushcart man said. \\nThe tarts were still warm from the oven. The smells were making her mouth water, but she did not have \\nthree coppers . . . or one. She gave the pushcart man a look, remembering what Syrio had told her about \\nseeing. He was short, with a little round belly, and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little. \\nShe was just thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when he \\nsaid, \"You be keepin\\' your filthy hands off. The gold cloaks know how to deal with thieving little gutter \\nrats, that they do.\" \\nArya glanced warily behind her. Two of the City Watch were standing at the mouth of an alley. Their \\ncloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a rich gold; their mail and boots and gloves were \\nblack. One wore a longsword at his hip, the other an iron cudgel. With a last wistful glance at the tarts, \\nArya edged back from the cart and hurried off. The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special \\nattention, but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots. Arya had been staying as far from the castle as \\nshe could get, yet even from a distance she could see the heads rotting atop the high red walls. Flocks of \\ncrows squabbled noisily over each head, thick as flies. The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks \\nhad thrown in with the Lannisters, their commander raised to a lord, with lands on the Trident and a seat \\non the king\\'s council. \\nShe had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to her. Some said her father had \\nmurdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord Renly. Others insisted that Renly had killed the \\nking in a drunken quarrel between brothers. Why else should he have fled in the night like a common \\nthief? One story said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting, another that he\\'d died eating a \\nboar, stuffing himself so full that he\\'d ruptured at the table. No, the king had died at table, others said, but \\nonly because Varys the Spider poisoned him. No, it had been the queen who poisoned him. No, he had \\ndied of a pox. No, he had choked on a fish bone. \\nOne thing all the stories agreed on: King Robert was dead. The bells in the seven towers of the Great \\nSept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze \\ntide. They only rang the bells like that for the death of a king, a tanner\\'s boy told Arya. \\nAll she wanted was to go home, but leaving King\\'s Landing was not so easy as she had hoped. Talk of \\nwar was on every lip, and gold cloaks were as thick on the city walls as fleas on . . . well, her, for one. \\nShe \\nhad been sleeping in Flea Bottom, on rooftops and in stables, wherever she could find a place to lie \\ndown, and it hadn\\'t taken her long to learn that the district was well named. \\nEvery day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn. \\nThe Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred. The Mud Gate and the \\nPage 480\\n\\nGate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out. \\nThose who were allowed to leave left by the King\\'s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in \\ncrimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying down from the roof of an \\ninn by the King\\'s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open their \\nsaddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot. \\nSometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush was wide and deep, and \\neveryone agreed that its currents were wicked and treacherous. She had no coin to pay a ferryman or \\ntake passage on a ship. \\nHer lord father had taught her never to steal, but it was growing harder to remember why. If she did not \\nget out soon, she would have to take her chances with the gold cloaks. She hadn\\'t gone hungry much \\nsince she learned to knock down birds with her stick sword, but she feared so much pigeon was making \\nher sick. A couple she\\'d eaten raw, before she found Flea Bottom. \\nIn the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew had been simmering for \\nyears, and you could trade half your bird for a heel of yesterday\\'s bread and a \"bowl o\\' brown,\" and \\nthey\\'d even stick the other half in the fire and crisp it up for you, so long as you plucked the feathers \\nyourself. Arya would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake, but the brown wasn\\'t so \\nbad. It usually had barley in it, and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip, and sometimes even apple, \\nwith a film of grease swimming on top. Mostly she tried not to think about the meat. Once she had gotten \\na piece of fish. \\nThe only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted down her food, Arya \\ncould feel them watching. Some of them stared at her boots or her cloak, and she knew what they were \\nthinking. With others, she could almost feel their eyes crawling under her leathers; she didn\\'t know what \\nthey were thinking, and that scared her even more. A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys \\nand chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her. \\nThe silver bracelet she\\'d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the castle, along with her \\nbundle of good clothes, snatched \\nwhile she slept in a burnt-out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled \\nin, the leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword . . . and Needle. She\\'d been lying on top of \\nNeedle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all the rest together. Since then \\nArya had taken to walking around with her cloak draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her \\nhip. The wooden sword she carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off \\nrobbers, but there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn\\'t have been scared off if she\\'d had a \\nbattle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread. Often as not, she went to \\nbed hungry rather than risk the stares. \\nOnce she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she might raid for apples and \\ncherries. Arya remembered seeing some from the kingsroad on the journey south. And she could dig for \\nroots in the forest, even run down some rabbits. In the city, the only things to run down were rats and \\ncats and scrawny dogs. The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, she\\'d heard, \\nbut she didn\\'t like to think about that. \\nDown below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross streets. Arya scrambled through \\nthe crowds, trying to put distance between her and the gold cloaks. She had learned to keep to the \\nPage 481\\n\\ncenter of the street. Sometimes she had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them \\ncoming. If you walked near the buildings, people grabbed you. In some alleys you couldn\\'t help but brush \\nagainst the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met. \\nA whooping gang of small children went running past, chasing a rolling hoop. Arya stared at them with \\nresentment, remembering the times she\\'d played at hoops with Bran and Jon and their baby brother \\nRickon. She wondered how big Rickon had grown, and whether Bran was sad. She would have given \\nanything if Jon had been here to call her \"little sister\" and muss her hair. Not that it needed mussing. She\\'d \\nseen her reflection in puddles, and she didn\\'t think hair got any more mussed than hers. \\nShe had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a friend who would give her a \\nplace to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or something. The little ones only looked at her with \\nquick, wary eyes and ran away if she came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions \\nArya couldn\\'t answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her. Only yesterday, a scrawny barefoot \\ngirl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her feet, but Arya gave her a \\ncrack on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off sobbing and bleeding. \\nA gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it \\nthoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think of the sea. Maybe that was \\nthe way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into \\nall kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. She decided to visit the riverfront. It was on the \\nway to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn\\'t checked that one today. \\nThe wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of gold cloaks, walking side \\nby side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her. Half the stalls were empty, and \\nit seemed to her that there were fewer ships at dock than she remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three \\nof the king\\'s war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as their oars rose and \\nfell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way along the river. \\nWhen she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed with white satin, her heart \\nalmost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell\\'s colors brought tears to her eyes. Behind them, a \\nsleek three-banked trading galley rocked at her moorings. Arya could not read the name painted on the \\nhull; the words were strange, Myrish, Braavosi, perhaps even High Valyrian. She grabbed a passing \\nlongshoreman by the sleeve. \"Please,\" she said, \"what ship is this?\" \\n\"She\\'s the Wind Witch, out of Myr,\" the man said. \\n\"She\\'s still here,\" Arya blurted. The longshoreman gave her a queer look, shrugged, and walked away. \\nArya ran toward the pier. The Wind Witch was the ship Father had hired to take her home . . . still \\nwaiting! She\\'d imagined it had sailed ages ago. \\nTwo of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his hand on the pommel of \\nhis sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, she stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes her \\neyes her eyes, why did . . . \\nLook with your eyes, she heard Syrio whisper. \\nArya looked. She knew all of her father\\'s men. The three in the grey cloaks were strangers. \"You,\" the \\none walking rounds called out. \"What do you want here, boy?\" The other two looked up from their dice. \\nPage 482\\n\\nIt was all Arya could do not to bolt and run, but she knew that if she did, they would be after her at \\nonce. She made herself walk closer. They were looking for a girl, but he thought she was a boy. She\\'d be \\na boy, then. \"Want to buy a pigeon?\" She showed him the dead bird. \\n\"Get out of here,\" the guardsman said. \\nArya did as he told her. She did not have to pretend to be frightened. Behind her, the men went back to \\ntheir dice. \\nShe could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom, but she was breathing hard by the time she \\nreached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between the hills. The Bottom had a stench to it, a stink of \\npigsties and stables and tanner\\'s sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap \\nwhorehouses. Arya wound her way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a wWiff of \\nbubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was gone. It must have \\nslipped from her belt as she ran, or someone had stolen it and she\\'d never noticed. For a moment she \\nwanted to cry again. She\\'d have to walk all the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that \\nplump. \\nFar across the city, bells began to ring. \\nArya glanced up, listening, wondering what the ringing meant this time. \\n\"What\\'s this now?\" a fat man called from the pot-shop. \\n\"The bells again, gods ha\\'mercy,\" wailed an old woman. \\nA red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a secondstory window. \"Is it the boy king \\nthat\\'s died now?\" she shouted down, leaning out over the street. \"Ah, that\\'s a boy for you, they never last \\nlong.\" As she laughed, a naked man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the \\nheavy white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift. \\n\"Stupid slut,\" the fat man shouted up. \"The king\\'s not dead, that\\'s only summoning bells. One tower \\ntolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the city.\" \\n\"Here, quit your biting, or I\\'ll ring your bells,\" the woman in the window said to the man behind her, \\npushing him off with an elbow. \"So who is it died, if not the king?\" \\n\"It\\'s a summoning,\" the fat man repeated. \\nTwo boys close to Arya\\'s age scampered past, splashing through a puddle. The old woman cursed \\nthem, but they kept right on going. Other people were moving too, heading up the hill to see what the \\nnoise was about. Arya ran after the slower boy. \"Where you going?\" she shouted when she was right \\nbehind him. \"What\\'s happening?\" \\nHe glanced back without slowing. \"The gold cloaks is carryin\\' him to the sept.\" \\n\"Who?\" she yelled, running hard. \\nPage 483\\n\\n\"The Hand! They\\'ll be taking his head off, Buu says.\" \\nA passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street. The boy leapt over, but Arya never saw it. She tripped \\nand fell, face first, scraping her \\nknee open on a stone and smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth. Needle \\ntangled between her legs. She sobbed as she struggled to her knees. The thumb of her left hand was \\ncovered with blood. When she sucked on it, she saw that half the thumbnail was gone, ripped off in her \\nfall. Her hands throbbed, and her knee was all bloody too. \\n\"Make way!\" someone shouted from the cross street. \"Make wayfor my lords of Red4yne!\" It was all \\nArya could do to get out of the road before they ran her down, four guardsmen on huge horses, \\npounding past at a gallop. They wore checked cloaks, blue-and-burgundy. Behind them, two young \\nlordlings rode side by side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod. Arya had seen them in the \\nbailey a hundred times; the Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, homely youths with orange hair \\nand square, freckled faces. Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and \\ngiggle whenever they caught sight of them. They did not look funny now. \\nEveryone was moving in the same direction, all in a hurry to see what the ringing was all about. The bells \\nseemed louder now, clanging, calling. Arya joined the stream of people. Her thumb hurt so bad where \\nthe nail had broken that it was all she could do not to cry. She bit her lip as she limped along, listening to \\nthe excited voices around her. \\n\"-the King\\'s Hand, Lord Stark. They\\'re carrying him up to Baelor\\'s Sept.\" \\n\"I heard he was dead.\" \\n\"Soon enough, soon enough. Here, I got me a silver stag says they lop his head off.\" \\n\"Past time, the traitor.\" The man spat. \\nArya struggled to find a voice. \"He never-\" she started, but she was only a child and they talked right \\nover her. \\n\"Fool! They ain\\'t neither going to lop him. Since when do they knick traitors on the steps of the Great \\nSept?\" \\n\"Well, they don\\'t mean to anoint him no knight. I heard it was Stark killed old King Robert. Slit his throat \\nin the woods, and when they found him, he stood there cool as you please and said it was some old boar \\ndid for His Grace.\" \\n\"Ah, that\\'s not true, it was his own brother did him, that Renly, him with his gold antlers.\" \\n\"You shut your lying mouth, woman. You don\\'t know what you\\'re saying, his lordship\\'s a fine true man.\" \\nBy the time they reached the Street of the Sisters, they were packed in shoulder to shoulder. Arya let the \\nhuman current carry her along, \\nPage 484\\n\\nup to the top of Visenya\\'s Hill. The white marble plaza was a solid mass of people, all yammering \\nexcitedly at each other and straining to get closer to the Great Sept of Baelor. The bells were very loud \\nhere. \\nArya squirmed through the press, ducking between the legs of horses and clutching tight to her sword \\nstick. From the middle of the crowd, all she could see were arms and legs and stomachs, and the seven \\nslender towers of the sept looming overhead. She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the \\nback where she might be able to see, but others had the same idea. The teamster cursed at them and \\ndrove them off with a crack of his whip. \\nArya grew frantic. Forcing her way to the front of the crowd, she was shoved up against the stone of a \\nplinth. She looked up at Baelor the Blessed, the septon king. Sliding her stick sword through her belt, \\nArya began to climb. Her broken thumbnail left smears of blood on the painted marble, but she made it \\nup, and wedged herself in between the king\\'s feet. \\nThat was when she saw her father. \\nLord Eddard stood on the High Septon\\'s pulpit outside the doors of the sept, supported between two of \\nthe gold cloaks. He was dressed in a rich grey velvet doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in \\nbeads, and a grey wool cloak trimmed with fur, but he was thinner than Arya had ever seen him, his long \\nface drawn with pain. He was not standing so much as being held up; the cast over his broken leg was \\ngrey and rotten. \\nThe High Septon himself stood behind him, a squat man, grey with age and ponderously fat, wearing \\nlong white robes and an immense crown of spun gold and crystal that wreathed his head with rainbows \\nwhenever he moved. \\nClustered around the doors of the sept, in front of the raised marble pulpit, were a knot of knights and \\nhigh lords. Joffrey was prominent among them, his raiment all crimson, silk and satin patterned with \\nprancing stags and roaring lions, a gold crown on his head. His queen mother stood beside him in a black \\nmourning gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in her hair. Arya recognized the Hound, \\nwearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor, with four of the Kingsguard around him. She saw \\nVarys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft slippers and a patterned damask robe, and she thought \\nthe short man with the silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for \\nMother. \\nAnd there in their midst was Sansa, dressed in sky-blue silk, with her long auburn hair washed and \\ncurled and silver bracelets on her \\nwrists. Arya scowled, wondering what her sister was doing here, why she looked so happy. \\nA long line of gold-cloaked spearmen held back the crowd, commanded by a stout man in elaborate \\narmor, all black lacquer and gold filigree. His cloak had the metallic shimmer of true cloth-of-gold. \\nWhen the bell ceased to toll, a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza, and her father lifted his head \\nand began to speak, his voice so thin and weak she could scarcely make him out. People behind her \\nbegan to shout out, \"What?\" and \"Louder!\" The man in the black-andgold armor stepped up behind \\nFather and prodded him sharply. You leave him alone! Arya wanted to shout, but she knew no one \\nPage 485\\n\\nwould listen. She chewed her lip. \\nHer father raised his voice and began again. \"I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the \\nKing,\" he said more loudly, his voice carrying across the plaza, \"and I come before you to confess my \\ntreason in the sight of gods and men.\" \\n\"No, \" Arya whimpered. Below her, the crowd began to scream and shout. Taunts and obscenities filled \\nthe air. Sansa had hidden her face in her hands. \\nHer father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. \"I betrayed the faith of my king and the trust \\nof my friend, Robert,\" he shouted. \"I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his blood was \\ncold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the throne for myself. Let the High Septon and \\nBaelor the Beloved and the Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one \\ntrue heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector \\nof the Realm.\" \\nA stone came sailing out of the crowd. Arya cried out as she saw her father hit. The gold cloaks kept \\nhim from falling. Blood ran down his face from a deep gash across his forehead. More stones followed. \\nOne struck the guard to Father\\'s left. Another went clanging off the breastplate of the knight in the \\nblack-and-gold armor. Two of the Kingsguard stepped in front of Joffrey and the queen, protecting them \\nwith their shields. \\nHer hand slid beneath her cloak and found Needle in its sheath. She tightened her fingers around the \\ngrip, squeezing as hard as she had ever squeezed anything. Please, gods, keep him safe, she prayed. \\nDon\\'t let them hurt my father. \\nThe High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother. \"As we sin, so do we suffer,\" he intoned, in a deep \\nswelling voice much louder than Father\\'s. \"This man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and \\nmen, here in this holy place.\" Rainbows danced around his head \\nas he lifted his hands in entreaty. \"The gods are just, yet Blessed Baelor taught us that they are also \\nmerciful. What shall be done with this traitor, Your Grace?\" \\nA thousand voices were screaming, but Arya never heard them. Prince Joffrey . . . no, King Joffrey . . . \\nstepped out from behind the shields of his Kingsguard. \"My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the \\nblack, and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father.\" He looked straight at Sansa then, and smiled, \\nand for a moment Arya thought that the gods had heard her prayer, until Joffrey turned back to the \\ncrowd and said, \"But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your king, treason shall never \\ngo unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!\" \\nThe crowd roared, and Arya felt the statue of Baelor rock as they surged against it. The High Septon \\nclutched at the king\\'s cape, and Varys came rushing over waving his arms, and even the queen was \\nsaying something to him, but Joffrey shook his head. Lords and knights moved aside as he stepped \\nthrough, tall and fleshless, a skeleton in iron mail, the King\\'s Justice. Dimly, as if from far off, Arya heard \\nher sister scream. Sansa had fallen to her knees, sobbing hysterically. Ser Ilyn Payne climbed the steps of \\nthe pulpit. \\nArya wriggled between Baelor\\'s feet and threw herself into the crowd, drawing Needle. She landed on a \\nman in a butcher\\'s apron, knocking him to the ground. Immediately someone slammed into her back and \\nPage 486\\n\\nshe almost went down herself. Bodies closed in around her, stumbling and pushing, trampling on the poor \\nbutcher. Arya slashed at them with Needle. \\nHigh atop the pulpit, Ser Ilyn Payne gestured and the knight in black-and-gold gave a command. The \\ngold cloaks flung Lord Eddard to the marble, with his head and chest out over the edge. \\n\"Here, you!\" an angry voice shouted at Arya, but she bowled past, shoving people aside, squirming \\nbetween them, slamming into anyone in her way. A hand fumbled at her leg and she hacked at it, kicked \\nat shins. A woman stumbled and Arya ran up her back, cutting to both sides, but it was no good, no \\ngood, there were too many people, no sooner did she make a hole than it closed again. Someone \\nbuffeted her aside. She could still hear Sansa screaming. \\nSer Ilyn drew a two-handed greatsword from the scabbard on his back. As he lifted the blade above his \\nhead, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any \\nrazor. ke, she thought, he has ke! Her tears streamed down her face, blinding her. \\nAnd then a hand shot out of the press and closed round her arm like \\na wolf trap, so hard that Needle went flying from her hand. Arya was wrenched off her feet. She would \\nhave fallen if he hadn\\'t held her up, as easy as if she were a doll. A face pressed close to hers, long black \\nhair and tangled beard and rotten teeth. \"Don\\'t look!\" a thick voice snarled at her. \\n\"I . . . I . I . . . Arya sobbed. \\nThe old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. \"Shut your mouth and close your eyes, boy.\" Dimly, as \\nif from far away, she heard a . . . a noise . . . a soft sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their \\nbreath at once. The old man\\'s fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. \"Look at me. Yes, that\\'s the way of \\nit, at me.\" Sour wine perfumed his breath. \"Remember, boy?\" \\nIt was the smell that did it. Arya saw the matted greasy hair, the patched, dusty black cloak that covered \\nhis twisted shoulders, the hard black eyes squinting at her. And she remembered the black brother who \\nhad come to visit her father. \\n\"Know me now, do you? There\\'s a bright boy.\" He spat. \"They\\'re done here. You\\'ll be coming with me, \\nand you\\'ll be keeping your mouth shut.\" When she started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. \\n\"Shut, I said.\" \\nThe plaza was beginning to empty. The press dissolved around them as people drifted back to their \\nlives. But Arya\\'s life was gone. Numb, she trailed along beside . . . Yoren, yes, his name is Yoren. She \\ndid not recall him finding Needle, until he handed the sword back to her. \"Hope you can use that, boy.\" \\n\"I\\'m not-\" she started. \\nHe shoved her into a doorway, thrust dirty fingers through her hair, and gave it a twist, yanking her head \\nback. \"-not a smart boy, that what you mean to say?\" \\nHe had a knife in his other hand. \\nAs the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking wildly, wrenching her head \\nPage 487\\n\\nfrom side to side, but he had her by the hair, so strong, she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips \\nthe salt taste of tears. \\nBRAN \\nThe oldest were men grown, seventeen and eighteen years from the day of their naming. One was past \\ntwenty. Most were younger, sixteen or less. \\nBran watched them from the balcony of Maester Luwin\\'s turret, listening to them grunt and strain and \\ncurse as they swung their staves and wooden swords. The yard was alive to the clack of wood on wood, \\npunctuated all too often by thwacks and yowls of pain when a blow struck leather or flesh. Ser Rodrik \\nstrode among the boys, face reddening beneath his white whiskers, muttering at them one and all. Bran \\nhad never seen the old knight look so fierce. \"No,\" he kept saying. \"No. No. No.\" \\n\"They don\\'t fight very well,\" Bran said dubiously. He scratched Summer idly behind the ears as the \\ndirewolf tore at a haunch of meat. Bones crunched between his teeth. \\n\"For a certainty,\" Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was peering through his big \\nMyrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the position of the comet that hung low in the morning \\nsky. \"Yet given time . . . Ser Rodrik has the truth of it, we need men to walk the walls. Your lord father \\ntook the cream of his guard to King\\'s Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all the likely \\nlads for leagues around. Many will not come back to us, and we must needs find the men to take their \\nplaces.\" \\nBran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below. \"If I still had my legs, I could beat them all.\" He \\nremembered the last time he\\'d held a sword in his hand, when the king had come to Winterfell. It was \\nonly a wooden sword, yet he\\'d knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times. \"Ser Rodrik should \\nteach me to use a poleaxe. If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft, Hodor could be my legs. We could be \\na knight together.\" \\n\"I think that . . . unlikely,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Bran, when a man fights, his arms and legs and thoughts \\nmust be as one.\" \\nPage 488\\n\\nBelow in the yard, Ser Rodrik was yelling. \"You fight like a goose. He pecks you and you peck him \\nharder. Pany! Block the blow. Goose fighting will not suffice. If those were real swords, the first peck \\nwould take your arm off!\" One of the other boys laughed, and the old knight rounded on him. \"You \\nlaugh. You. Now that is gall. You fight like a hedgehog . . .\" \\n\"There was a knight once who couldn\\'t see,\" Bran said stubbornly, as Ser Rodrik went on below. \"Old \\nNan told me about him. He had a long staff with blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and \\nchop two men at once.\" \\n\"Symeon Star-Eyes,\" Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book. \"When he lost his eyes, he put star \\nsapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim. Bran, that is only a story, like the tales of Florian \\nthe Fool. A fable from the Age of Heroes.\" The maester tsked. \"You must put these dreams aside, they \\nwill only break your heart.\" \\nThe mention of dreams reminded him. \"I dreamed about the crow again last night. The one with three \\neyes. He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come with him, so I did. We went down to the crypts. \\nFather was there, and we talked. He was sad.\" \\n\"And why was that?\" Luwin peered through his tube. \\n\"It was something to do about Jon, I think.\" The dream had been deeply disturbing, more so than any of \\nthe other crow dreams. \"Hodor won\\'t go down into the crypts.\" \\nThe maester had only been half listening, Bran could tell. He lifted his eye from the tube, blinking. \\n\"Hodor won\\'t . . . T\\' \\n\"Go down into the crypts. When I woke, I told him to take me down, to see if Father was truly there. At \\nfirst he didn\\'t know what I was saying, but I got him to the steps by telling him to go here and go there, \\nonly then he wouldn\\'t go down. He just stood on the top step and said \\'Hodor,\\' like he was scared of the \\ndark, but I had a torch. It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is always \\ndoing.\" He saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added, \"I didn\\'t, though.\" \\nPage 489\\n\\n\"Good. Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.\" \\n\"In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I can\\'t do that when I\\'m awake,\" Bran explained. \\n\"Why would you want to go down to the crypts?\" \\n\"I told you. To look for Father.\" \\nThe maester tugged at the chain around his neck, as he often did when he was uncomfortable. \"Bran, \\nsweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, beside his father and his father\\'s father and all \\nthe Starks back to the old Kings in the North . . . but that will not be for many years, gods be good. \\nYour father is a prisoner of the queen in King\\'s Landing. You will not find him in the crypts.\" \\n\"He was there last night. I talked to him.\" \\n\"Stubborn boy,\" the maester sighed, setting his book aside. \"Would you like to go see?\" \\n\"I can\\'t. Hodor won\\'t go, and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer.\" \\n\"I believe I can solve that difficulty.\" \\nIn place of Hodor, the wildling woman Osha was summoned. She was tall and tough and uncomplaining, \\nwilling to go wherever she was commanded. \"I lived my life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won\\'t \\nfret me none, m\\'lords,\" she said. \\n\"Summer, come,\" Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms. The direwolf left his bone and \\nfollowed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down the spiral steps to the cold vault under the \\nearth. Maester Luwin went ahead with a torch. Bran did not even mind-too badly-that she carried him in \\nPage 490\\n\\nher arms and not on her back. Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha\\'s chain struck off, since she had served \\nfaithfully and well since she had been at Winterfell. She still wore the heavy iron shackles around her \\nankles-a sign that she was not yet wholly trusted-but they did not hinder her sure strides down the steps. \\nBran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts. It had been before, for certain. When he \\nwas little, he used to play down here with Robb and Jon and his sisters. \\nHe wished they were here now; the vault might not have seemed so dark and scary. Summer stalked out \\nin the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and sniffed the chill dead air. He bared his teeth and \\ncrept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester\\'s torch. Even Osha, hard as old iron, \\nseemed uncomfortable. \"Grim folk, by the look of them,\" she said as she eyed the long row of granite \\nStarks on their stone thrones. \\n\"They were the Kings of Winter,\" Bran whispered. Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place. \\nOsha smiled. \"Winter\\'s got no king. If you\\'d seen it, you\\'d know that, summer boy.\" \\n\"They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,\" Maester Luwin said, lifting the torch high so \\nthe light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that \\ncrouched by their feet. Others were shaved clean, their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron \\nlongswords across their laps. \"Hard men for a hard time. Come.\" He strode briskly down the vault, past \\nthe procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures. A tongue of flame trailed back from the \\nupraised torch as he went. \\nThe vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told him once that there were other \\nlevels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried. It would not do to \\nlose the light. Summer refused to move from the steps, even when Osha followed the torch, Bran in her \\narms. \\n\"Do you recall your history, Bran?\" the maester said as they walked. \"Tell Osha who they were and \\nwhat they did, if you can.\" \\nPage 491\\n\\nHe looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester had told him the stories, \\nand Old Nan had made them come alive. \"That one is Jon Stark. When the sea raiders landed in the east, \\nhe drove them out and built the castle at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father\\'s father \\nbut another Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter. Theon \\nStark\\'s the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard. They called him the \\'Hungry Wolf,\\' \\nbecause he was always at war. That\\'s a Brandon, the tall one with the dreamy face, he was Brandon the \\nShipwright, because he loved the sea. His tomb is empty. He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and \\nwas never seen again. His son was Brandon the Burner, because he put the torch to all his father\\'s ships \\nin grief. There\\'s Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island in a wrestling match and gave it to the Mormonts. \\nAnd that\\'s Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt. He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of \\nWinterfell, after he yielded to Aegon the Conqueror. Oh, there, he\\'s Cregan Stark. He fought with Prince \\nAemon once, and the Dragonknight said he\\'d never faced a finer swordsman.\" They were almost at the \\nend now, and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him. \"And there\\'s my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who \\nwas beheaded by Mad King Aerys. His daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside \\nhim. Not me, another Brandon, my father\\'s brother. \\nThey\\'re not supposed to have statues, that\\'s only for the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so \\nmuch he had them done.\" \\n\"The maid\\'s a fair one,\" Osha said. \\n\"Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and raped her,\" Bran explained. \\n\"Robert fought a war to win her back. He killed Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, but Lyanna \\ndied and he never got her back at all.\" \\n\"A sad tale,\" said Osha, \"but those empty holes are sadder.\" \\n\"Lord Eddard\\'s tomb, for when his time comes,\" Maester Luwin said. \"Is this where you saw your father \\nin your dream, Bran?\" \\n\"Yes.\" The memory made him shiver. He looked around the vault uneasily, the hairs on the back of his \\nneck bristling. Had he heard a noise? Was there someone here? \\nPage 492\\n\\nMaester Luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre, torch in hand. \"As you see, he\\'s not here. Nor will \\nhe be, for many a year. Dreams are only dreams, child.\" He thrust his arm into the blackness inside the \\ntomb, as into the mouth of some great beast. \"Do you see? It\\'s quite empt-\" \\nThe darkness sprang at him, snarling. \\nBran saw eyes like green fire, a flash of teeth, fur as black as the pit around them. Maester Luwin yelled \\nand threw up his hands. The torch went flying from his fingers, caromed off the stone face of Brandon \\nStark, and tumbled to the statue\\'s feet, the flames licking up his legs. In the drunken shifting torchlight, \\nthey saw Luwin struggling with the direwolf, beating at his muzzle with one hand while the jaws closed on \\nthe other. \\n\"Summer!\" Bran screamed. \\nAnd Summer came, shooting from the dimness behind them, a leaping shadow. He slammed into \\nShaggydog and knocked him back, and the two direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and \\nblack fur, snapping and biting at each other, while Maester Luwin struggled to his knees, his arm torn and \\nbloody. Osha propped Bran up against Lord Rickard\\'s stone wolf as she hurried to assist the maester. In \\nthe light of the guttering torch, shadow wolves twenty feet tall fought on the wall and roof. \\n\"Shaggy,\" a small voice called. When Bran looked up, his little brother was standing in the mouth of \\nFather\\'s tomb. With one final snap at Summer\\'s face, Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon\\'s \\nside. \"You let my father be,\" Rickon warned Luwin. \"You let him be.\" \\n\"Rickon,\" Bran said softly. \"Father\\'s not here.\" \\n\"Yes he is. I saw him.\" Tears glistened on Rickon\\'s face. \"I saw him last night.\" \\n\"In your dream ... ?\\' \\nPage 493\\n\\nRickon nodded. \"You leave him. You leave him be. He\\'s coming home now, like he promised. He\\'s \\ncoming home.\" \\nBran had never seen Maester Luwin took so uncertain before. Blood dripped down his arm where \\nShaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh beneath. \"Osha, the torch,\" he said, biting \\nthrough his pain, and she snatched it up before it went out. Soot stains blackened both legs of his uncle\\'s \\nlikeness. \"That . . . that beast,\" Luwin went on, \"is supposed to be chained up in the kennels.\" \\nRickon patted Shaggydog\\'s muzzle, damp with blood. \"I let him loose. He doesn\\'t like chains.\" He licked \\nat his fingers. \\n\"Rickon,\" Bran said, \"would you like to come with me?\" \\n\"No. I like it here.\" \\n\"It\\'s dark here. And cold.\" \\n\"I\\'m not afraid. I have to wait for Father.\" \\n\"You can wait with me,\" Bran said. \"We\\'ll wait together, you and me and our wolves.\" Both of the \\ndirewolves were licking wounds now, and would bear close watching. \\n\"Bran,\" the maester said firmly, \"I know you mean well, but Shaggydog is too wild to run loose. I\\'m the \\nthird man he\\'s savaged. Give him the freedom of the castle and it\\'s only a question of time before he kills \\nsomeone. The truth is hard, but the wolf has to be chained, or .\" He hesitated. \\nor killed, Bran thought, but what he said was, \"He was not made for chains. We will wait in your tower, \\nall of us.\" \\nPage 494\\n\\n\"That is quite impossible,\" Maester Luwin said. \\nOsha grinned. \"The boy\\'s the lordling here, as I recall.\" She handed Luwin back his torch and scooped \\nBran up into her arms again. \"The maester\\'s tower it is.\" \\n\"Will you come, Rickon?\" \\nHis brother nodded. \"If Shaggy comes too,\" he said, running after Osha and Bran, and there was nothing \\nMaester Luwin could do but follow, keeping a wary eye on the wolves. \\nMaester Luwin\\'s turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything. \\nTottering piles of books covered tables and chairs, rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves, candle stubs \\nand puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture, the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace \\ndoor, star charts hung from the walls, shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes, papers, quills, and \\npots of inks were everywhere, and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters. \\nTheir strident quorks drifted down from above as Osha washed and cleaned and bandaged the maester\\'s \\nwounds, under Luwin\\'s terse instruction. \"This is folly,\" the small grey man said while she dabbed at the \\nwolf bites with a stinging ointment. \"I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same dream, \\nyet when you stop to consider it, it\\'s only natural. You miss your lord father, and you know that he is a \\ncaptive. Fear can fever a man\\'s mind and give him queer thoughts. Rickon is too young to comprehend-\" \\n\"I\\'m four now,\" Rickon said. He was peeking through the lens tube at the gargoyles on the First Keep. \\nThe direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round room, licking their wounds and gnawing on \\nbones. \\n\"-too young, and-ooh, seven hells, that burns, no, don\\'t stop, more. Too young, as I say, but you, Bran, \\nyou\\'re old enough to know that dreams are only dreams.\" \\n\"Some are, some aren\\'t.\" Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash. Luwin gasped. \"The children of \\nthe forest could tell you a thing or two about dreaming.\" \\nPage 495\\n\\nTears were streaming down the maester\\'s face, yet he shook his head doggedly. \"The children . . . live \\nonly in dreams. Now. Dead and gone. Enough, that\\'s enough. Now the bandages. Pads and then wrap, \\nand make it tight, I\\'ll be bleeding.\" \\n\"Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that they could fly like birds and swim like fish \\nand talk to the animals,\" Bran said. \"She says that they made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a \\nlittle baby just to hear it.\" \\n\"And all this they did with magic,\" Maester Luwin said, distracted. \"I wish they were here now. A spell \\nwould heal my arm less painfully, and they could talk to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite.\" He gave the \\nbig black wolf an angry glance out of the corner of his eye. \"Take a lesson, Bran. The man who trusts in \\nspells is dueling with a glass sword. As the children did. Here, let me show you something.\" He stood \\nabruptly, crossed the room, and returned with a green jar in his good hand. \"Have a look at these,\" he \\nsaid as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of shiny black arrowheads. \\nBran picked one up. \"It\\'s made of glass.\" Curious, Rickon drifted closer to peer over the table. \\n\"Dragonglass,\" Osha named it as she sat down beside Luwin, bandagings in hand. \\n\"Obsidian,\" Maester Luwin insisted, holding out his wounded arm. \"Forged in the fires of the gods, far \\nbelow the earth. The children of the forest hunted with that, thousands of years ago. The children worked \\nno metal. In place of mail, they wore long shirts of woven \\nleaves and bound their legs in bark, so they seemed to melt into the wood. In place of swords, they \\ncarried blades of obsidian.\" \\n\"And still do.\" Osha placed soft pads over the bites on the maester\\'s forearm and bound them tight with \\nlong strips of linen. \\nPage 496\\n\\nBran held the arrowhead up close. The black glass was slick and shiny. He thought it beautiful. \"Can I \\nkeep one?\" \\n\"As you wish,\" the maester said. \\n\"I want one too,\" Rickon said. \"I want four. I\\'m four.\" \\nLuwin made him count them out. \"Careful, they\\'re still sharp. Don\\'t cut yourself.\" \\n\"Tell me about the children,\" Bran said. It was important. \\n\"What do you wish to know?\" \\n\"Everything.\" \\nMaester Luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. \"They were people of the \\nDawn Age, the very first, before kings and kingdoms,\" he said. \"In those days, there were no castles or \\nholdfasts, no cities, not so much as a market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne. There \\nwere no men at all. Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven Kingdoms. \\n\"They were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even when grown to \\nmanhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Slight as \\nthey were, the children were quick and graceful. Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows \\nand flying snares. Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names \\nare secret. Their wise men were called greenseers, and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep \\nwatch on the woods. How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can know. \\n\"But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, crossing the Broken Arm \\nof Dorne before it was broken. They came with bronze swords and great leathern shields, riding horses. \\nNo horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea. No doubt the children were as frightened by \\nthe horses as the First Men were by the faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out holdfasts and \\nfarms, they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horrorstruck, the children went to war. The old \\nPage 497\\n\\nsongs say that the greenseers used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, \\nshattering the Arm, but it was too late to close the door. The wars went on until the earth ran red with \\nblood of men and children both, but more children than men, for men were bigger and stronger, and \\nwood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze. Finally the wise of both races prevailed, \\nand the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met \\nthe greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the great lake called \\nGods Eye. \\n\"There they forged the Pact. The First Men were given the coastlands, the high plains and bright \\nmeadows, the mountains and bogs, but the deep woods were to remain forever the children\\'s, and no \\nmore weirwoods were to be put to the axe anywhere in the realm. So the gods might bear witness to the \\nsigning, every tree on the island was given a face, and afterward, the sacred order of green men was \\nformed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces. \\n\"The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children. In time, the First Men \\neven put aside the gods they had brought with them, and took up the worship of the secret gods of the \\nwood. The signing of the Pact ended the Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes.\" \\nBran\\'s fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead. \"But the children of the forest are all gone now, you \\nsaid.\" \\n\"Here, they are,\" said Osha, as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her teeth. \"North of the Wall, \\nthings are different. That\\'s where the children went, and the giants, and the other old races.\" \\nMaester Luwin sighed. \"Woman, by rights you ought to be dead or in chains. The Starks have treated \\nyou more gently than you deserve. It is unkind to repay them for their kindness by filling the boys\\' heads \\nwith folly.\" \\n\"Tell me where they went,\" Bran said. \"I want to know.\" \\nPage 498\\n\\n\"Me too,\" Rickon echoed. \\n\"Oh, very well,\" Luwin muttered. \"So long as the kingdoms of the First Men held sway, the Pact \\nendured, all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and the birth of the Seven Kingdoms, yet \\nfinally there came a time, many centuries later, when other peoples crossed the narrow sea. \\n\"The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with steel and fire and the \\nseven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests. The wars lasted hundreds of years, but in the \\nend the six southron kingdoms all fell before them. Only here, where the King in the North threw back \\nevery army that tried to cross the Neck, did the rule of the First Men endure. The Andals burnt out the \\nweirwood groves, hacked down the faces, slaughtered the children where they found them, and \\neverywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods. So the children fled north-\" \\nSummer began to howl. \\nMaester Luwin broke off, startled. When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and added his voice to his \\nbrother\\'s, dread clutched at Bran\\'s \\nheart. \"It\\'s coming, \" he whispered, with the certainty of despair. He had known it since last night, he \\nrealized, since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell. He had known it, but he had \\nnot believed. He had wanted Maester Luwin to be right. The crow, he thought, the three-eyed crow . . . \\nThe howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Summer padded across the tower floor to \\nShaggydog, and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of his brother\\'s neck. From the window \\ncame a flutter of wings. \\nA raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its beak, and gave a harsh, raucous rattle of distress. \\nRickon began to cry. His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and clattered on the floor. Bran \\npulled him close and hugged him. \\nPage 499\\n\\nMaester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers. He rose, slow as a \\nsleepwalker, and moved to the window. When he whistled, the raven hopped onto his bandaged \\nforearm. There was dried blood on its wings. \"A hawk,\" Luwin murmured, \"perhaps an owl. Poor thing, \\na wonder it got through.\" He took the letter from its leg. \\nBran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper. \"What is it?\" he said, holding his brother \\nall the harder. \\n\"You know what it is, boy,\" Osha said, not unkindly. She put her hand on his head. \\nMaester Luwin looked up at them numbly, a small grey man with blood on the sleeve of his grey wool \\nrobe and tears in his bright grey eyes. \"My lords,\" he said to the sons, in a voice gone hoarse and \\nshrunken, \"we . . . we shall need to find a stonecarver who knew his likeness well . . .\" \\nSANSA \\nIn the tower room at the heart of Maegor\\'s Holdfast, Sansa gave herself to the darkness. \\nShe drew the curtains around her bed, slept, woke weeping, \\nand slept again. When she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief. Servants came \\nand went, bringing meals, but the sight of food was more than she could bear. The dishes piled up on the \\ntable beneath her window, untouched and spoiling, until the servants took them away again. \\nSometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and she woke from it more tired than when she had \\nclosed her eyes. Yet those were the best times, for when she dreamed, she dreamed of Father. Waking \\nor sleeping, she saw him, saw the gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing \\nIce from the scabbard on his back, saw the moment . . . the moment when . . . she had wanted to look \\naway, she had wanted to, her legs had gone out from under her and she had fallen to her knees, yet \\nsomehow she could not turn her head, and all the people were screaming and shouting, and her prince \\nPage 500\\n\\nhad smiled at her, he\\'d smiled and she\\'d felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until he said those words, and \\nher father\\'s legs . . . that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they\\'d jerked when Ser Ilyn . . . \\nwhen the sword . . . \\nPerhaps I will die too, she told herself, and the thought did not seem \\nso terrible to her. If she flung herself from the window, she could put an end to her suffering, and in the \\nyears to come the singers would write songs of her grief. Her body would lie on the stones below, \\nbroken and innocent, shaming all those who had betrayed her. Sansa went so far as to cross the \\nbedchamber and throw open the shutters . . . but then her courage left her, and she ran back to her bed, \\nsobbing. \\nThe serving girls tried to talk to her when they brought her meals, but she never answered them. Once \\nGrand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and bottles, to ask if she was ill. He felt her brow, \\nmade her undress, and touched her all over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a \\npotion of honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all right then \\nand went back to sleep. \\nShe dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on stone as a man climbed \\nslowly toward her bedchamber, step by step. All she could do was huddle behind her door and listen, \\ntrembling, as he came closer and closer. It was Ser Ilyn Payne, she knew, coming for her with Ice in his \\nhand, coming to take her head. There was no place to run, no place to hide, no way to bar the door. \\nFinally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside, standing there silent with his dead eyes \\nand his long pocked face. That was when she realized she was naked. She crouched down, trying to \\ncover herself with her hands, as her door began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword \\npoking through . . . \\nShe woke murmuring, \"Please, please, I\\'ll be good, I\\'ll be good, please don\\'t,\" but there was no one to \\nhear. \\nWhen they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard their footsteps. It was Joffrey who opened \\nher door, not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince. She was in bed, curled up tight, her curtains \\ndrawn, and she could not have said if it was noon or midnight. The first thing she heard was the slam of \\nthe door. Then her bed hangings were yanked back, and she threw up a hand against the sudden light \\nand saw them standing over her. \\nPage 501\\n\\n\"You will attend me in court this afternoon,\" Joffrey said. \"See that you bathe and dress as befits my \\nbetrothed.\" Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain brown doublet and green mantle, his burned \\nface hideous in the morning light. Behind them were two knights of the Mngsguard in long white satin \\ncloaks. \\nSansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself. \"No,\" she whimpered, \"please . . . leave me be.\" \\n\"If you won\\'t rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for you,\" Joffrey said. \\n\"I beg of you, my prince \\n\"I\\'m king now. Dog, get her out of bed.\" \\nSandor Clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the featherbed as she struggled \\nfeebly. Her blanket fell to the floor. Underneath she had only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness. \\n\"Do as you\\'re bid, child,\" Clegane said. \"Dress.\" He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently. \\nSansa backed away from them. \"I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I wrote what she told me. \\nYou promised you\\'d be merciful. Please, let me go home. I won\\'t do any treason, I\\'ll be good, I swear it, \\nI don\\'t have traitor\\'s blood, I don\\'t. I only want to go home.\" Remembering her courtesies, she lowered \\nher head. \"As it please you,\" she finished weakly. \\n\"It does not please me,\" Joffrey said. \"Mother says I\\'m still to marry you, so you\\'ll stay here, and you\\'ll \\nobey.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want to marry you,\" Sansa wailed. \"You chopped off my father\\'s head!\" \\nPage 502\\n\\n\"He was a traitor. I never promised to spare him, only that I\\'d be merciful, and I was. If he hadn\\'t been \\nyour father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave him a clean death.\" \\nSansa stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a padded crimson doublet patterned \\nwith lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that framed his face. She wondered how she could \\never have thought him handsome. His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain, and \\nhis eyes were vain and cruel. \"I hate you,\" she whispered. \\nKing Joffrey\\'s face hardened. \"My mother tells me that it isn\\'t fitting that a king should strike his wife. Ser \\nMeryn.\" \\nThe knight was on her before she could think, yanking back her hand as she tried to shield her face and \\nbackhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist. Sansa did not remember failing, yet the next she knew \\nshe was sprawled on one knee amongst the rushes. Her head was ringing. Ser Meryn Trant stood over \\nher, with blood on the knuckles of his white silk glove. \\n\"Will you obey now, or shall I have him chastise you again?\" \\nSansa\\'s ear felt numb. She touched it, and her fingertips came away wet and red. \"I . . . as . . . as you \\ncommand, my lord.\" \\n\"Your Grace, \" Joffrey corrected her. \"I shall look for you in court.\" He turned and left. \\nSer Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane \\n650 GLORGL R.R. MARTIN \\nlingered long enough to yank her roughly to her feet. \"Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he \\nwants.\" \\nPage 503\\n\\n\"What . . . what does he want? Please, tell me.\" \\n\"He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love,\" the Hound rasped. \"He wants to hear you \\nrecite all your pretty little words the way the septa taught you. He wants you to love him . . . and fear \\nhim.\" \\nAfter he was gone, Sansa sank back onto the rushes, staring at the wall until two of her bedmaids crept \\ntimidly into the chamber. \"I will need hot water for my bath, please,\" she told them, \"and perfume, and \\nsome powder to hide this bruise.\" The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache, but she \\nknew Joffrey would want her to be beautiful. \\nThe hot water made her think of Winterfell, and she took strength from that. She had not washed since \\nthe day her father died, and she was startled at how filthy the water became. Her maids sluiced the blood \\noff her face, scrubbed the dirt from her back, washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in \\nthick auburn curls. Sansa did not speak to them, except to give them commands; they were Lannister \\nservants, not her own, and she did not trust them. When the time came to dress, she chose the green silk \\ngown that she had worn to the tourney. She recalled how gallant Joff had been to her that night at the \\nfeast. Perhaps it would make him remember as well, and treat her more gently. \\nShe drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits as she waited, to settle her stomach. \\nIt was midday when Ser Meryn returned. He had donned his white armor; a shirt of enameled scales \\nchased with gold, a tall helm with a golden sunburst crest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of \\ngleaming plate, a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion. His visor had been removed from his \\nhelm, to better show his dour face; pouchy bags under his eyes, a wide sour mouth, rusty hair spotted \\nwith grey. \"My lady,\" he said, bowing, as if he had not beaten her bloody only three hours past. \"His \\nGrace has instructed me to escort you to the throne room.\" \\n\"Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?\" \\n\"Are you refusing to come, my lady?\" The look he gave her was without expression. He did not so much \\nas glance at the bruise he had left her. \\nHe did not hate her, Sansa realized; neither did he love her. He felt nothing for her at all. She was only a \\n. . . a thing to him. \"No,\" she said, rising. She wanted to rage, to hurt him as he\\'d hurt her, to warn him \\nthat when she was queen she would have him exiled if he ever \\nPage 504\\n\\ndared strike her again ... but she remembered what the Hound had told her, so all she said was, \"I shall \\ndo whatever His Grace commands.\" \\n\"As I do,\" he replied. \\n\"Yes . . . but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn.\" \\nSandor Clegane would have laughed at that, Sansa knew. Other men might have cursed her, warned her \\nto keep silent, even begged for her forgiveness. Ser Meryn Trant did none of these. Ser Meryn Trant \\nsimply did not care. \\nThe balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, fighting to hold back her \\ntears, while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and dispensed what it pleased him to call justice. Nine \\ncases out of ten seemed to bore him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming restlessly while \\nLord Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did choose to \\nmake a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him. \\nA thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, right there in court. Two knights \\ncame to him with a dispute about some land, and he decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow. \\n\"To the death,\" he added. A woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. \\nShe had loved him, she said, and she wanted to see him decently buried. \"If you loved a traitor, you must \\nbe a traitor too,\" Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to the dungeons. \\nFrog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black velvet doublet and a shiny \\ncloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard \\nat his ugly face, remembering how he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she \\ncould hurt him, wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice inside her \\nwhispered, There are no heroes, and she remembered what Lord Petyr had said to her, here in this very \\nhall. \"Life is not a song, sweetling,\" he\\'d told her. \"You may learn that one day to your sorrow.\" In life, the \\nmonsters win, she told herself, and now it was the Hound\\'s voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. \\n\"Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.\" \\nPage 505\\n\\nThe last case was a plump tavern singer, accused of making a song that ridiculed the late King Robert. \\nJoff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and ordered him to perform the song for the court. The \\nsinger wept and swore he would never sing that song again, but the king insisted. It was sort of a funny \\nsong, all about Robert fighting with a pig. The pig was the boar who\\'d killed him, Sansa knew, but in \\nsome \\nverses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen. When the song was done, Joffrey \\nannounced that he\\'d decided to be merciful. The singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue. He \\nwould have a day to make his choice. Janos Slynt nodded. \\nThat was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but her ordeal was not yet done. \\nWhen the herald\\'s voice dismissed the court, she fled the balcony, only to find Joffrey waiting for her at \\nthe base of the curving stairs. The Hound was with him, and Ser Meryn as well. The young king \\nexamined her critically, top to bottom. \"You look much better than you did.\" \\n\"Thank you, Your Grace,\" Sansa said. Hollow words, but they made him nod and smile. \\n\"Walk with me,\" Jofftey commanded, offering her his arm. She had no choice but to take it. The touch of \\nhis hand would have thrilled her once; now it made her flesh crawl. \"My name day will be here soon,\" \\nJoffrey said as they slipped out the rear of the throne room. \"There will be a great feast, and gifts. What \\nare you going to give me?\" \\n\"I . . . I had not thought, my lord.\" \\n\"Your Grace,\" he said sharply. \"You truly are a stupid girl, aren\\'t you? My mother says so.\" \\n\"She does?\" After all that had happened, his words should have lost their power to hurt her, yet \\nsomehow they had not. The queen had always been so kind to her. \\n\"Oh, yes. She worries about our children, whether they\\'ll be stupid like you, but I told her not to trouble \\nherself.\" The king gestured, and Ser Meryn opened a door for them. \\nPage 506\\n\\n\"Thank you, Your Grace,\" she murmured. The Hound was right, she thought, I am only a little bird, \\nrepeating the words they taught me. The sun had fallen below the western wall, and the stones of the Red \\nKeep glowed dark as blood. \\n\"I\\'ll get you with child as soon as you\\'re able,\" Joffrey said as he escorted her across the practice yard. \\n\"If the first one is stupid, I\\'ll chop off your head and find a smarter wife. When do you think you\\'ll be able \\nto have children?\" \\nSansa could not look at him, he shamed her so. \"Septa Mordane says most . . . most highborn girls have \\ntheir flowering at twelve or thirteen.\" \\nJoffrey nodded. \"This way.\" He led her into the gatehouse, to the base of the steps that led up to the \\nbattlements. \\nSansa jerked back away from him, trembling. Suddenly she knew where they were going. \"No, \" she \\nsaid, her voice a frightened gasp. \"Please, no, don\\'t make me, I beg you . . .\" \\nJoffrey pressed his lips together. \"I want to show you what happens to traitors.\" \\nSansa shook her head wildly. \"I won\\'t. I won\\'t.\" \\n\"I can have Ser Meryn drag you up,\" he said. \"You won\\'t like that. You had better do what I say.\" \\nJoffrey reached for her, and Sansa cringed away from him, backing into the Hound. \\n\"Do it, girl,\" Sandor Clegane told her, pushing her back toward the king. His mouth twitched on the \\nburned side of his face and Sansa could almost hear the rest of it. He\\'ll have you up there no matter what, \\nso give him what he wants. \\nPage 507\\n\\nShe forced herself to take King Joffrey\\'s hand. The climb was something out of a nightmare; every step \\nwas a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of ankle-deep mud, and there were more steps than she \\nwould have believed, a thousand thousand steps, and horror waiting on the ramparts. \\nFrom the high battlements of the gatehouse, the whole world spread out below them. Sansa could see \\nthe Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya\\'s hill, where her father had died. At the other end of the Street of \\nthe Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins of the Dragonpit. To the west, the swollen red sun was \\nhalf-hidden behind the Gate of the Gods. The salt sea was at her back, and to the south was the fish \\nmarket and the docks and the swirling torrent of the Blackwater Rush. And to the north . . . \\nShe turned that way, and saw only the city, streets and alleys and hills and bottoms and more streets and \\nmore alleys and the stone of distant walls. Yet she knew that beyond them was open country, farms and \\nfields and forests, and beyond that, north and north and north again, stood Winterfell. \\n\"What are you looking at?\" Joffrey said. \"This is what I wanted you to see, right here.\" \\nA thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high as Sansa\\'s chin, with \\ncrenellations cut into it every five feet for archers. The heads were mounted between the crenels, along \\nthe top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes so they faced out over the city. Sansa had noted them the \\nmoment she\\'d stepped out onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun \\nwere ever so much prettier. He can make me look at the heads, she told herself, but he can\\'t make me \\nsee them. \\n\"This one is your father,\" he said. \"This one here. Dog, turn it around so she can see him.\" \\nSandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned it. The severed head had been dipped in tar to \\npreserve it longer. Sansa looked at \\nit calmly, not seeing it at all. It did not really look like Lord Eddard, she thought; it did not even look \\nreaL \"How long do I have to look?\" \\nPage 508\\n\\nJoffrey seemed disappointed. \"Do you want to see the rest?\" There was a long row of them. \\n\"If it please Your Grace.\" \\nJoffrey marched her down the wallwalk, past a dozen more heads and two empty spikes. \"I\\'m saving \\nthose for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly,\" he explained. The other heads had been dead and \\nmounted much longer than her father. Despite the tar, most were long past being recognizable. The king \\npointed to one and said, \"That\\'s your septa there,\" but Sansa could not even have told that it was a \\nwoman. The jaw had rotted off her face, and birds had eaten one ear and most of a cheek. \\nSansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane, although she supposed she had known all \\nalong. \"Why did you kill her?\" she asked. \"She was godsworn . . .\" \\n\"She was a traitor.\" Joffrey looked pouty; somehow she was upsetting him. \"You haven\\'t said what you \\nmean to give me for my name day. Maybe I should give you something instead, would you like that?\" \\n\"If it please you, my lord,\" Sansa said. \\nWhen he smiled, she knew he was mocking her. \"Your brother is a traitor too, you know.\" He turned \\nSepta Mordane\\'s head back around. \"I remember your brother from Winterfell. My dog called him the \\nlord of the wooden sword. Didn\\'t you, dog?\" \\n\"Did IT\\' the Hound replied. \"I don\\'t recall.\" \\nJoffrey gave a petulant shrug. \"Your brother defeated my uncle Jaime. My mother says it was treachery \\nand deceit. She wept when she heard. Women are all weak, even her, though she pretends she isn\\'t. She \\nsays we need to stay in King\\'s Landing in case my other uncles attack, but I don\\'t care. After my name \\nday feast, I\\'m going to raise a host and kill your brother myself. That\\'s what I\\'ll give you, Lady Sansa. \\nYour brother\\'s head.\" \\nA kind of madness took over her then, and she heard herself say, \"Maybe my brother will give me your \\nPage 509\\n\\nhead.\" \\nJoffrey scowled. \"You must never mock me like that. A true wife does not mock her lord. Ser Meryn, \\nteach her.\" \\nThis time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he struck her. He hit her \\ntwice, left to right, and harder, right to left. Her lip split and blood ran down her chin, to mingle with the \\nsalt of her tears. \\n\"You shouldn\\'t be crying all the time,\" Joffrey told her. \"You\\'re more pretty when you smile and laugh.\" \\nSansa made herself smile, afraid that he would have Ser Meryn hit her again if she did not, but it was no \\ngood, the king still shook his head. \"Wipe off the blood, you\\'re all messy.\" \\nThe outer parapet came up to her chin, but along the inner edge of the walk was nothing, nothing but a \\nlong plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below. All it would take was a shove, she told herself. He \\nwas standing right there, right there, smirking at her with those fat wormlips. You could do it, she told \\nherself. You could. Do it right now. It wouldn\\'t even matter if she went over with him. It wouldn\\'t matter \\nat all. \\n\"Here, girl.\" Sandor Clegane knelt before her, between her and Joffrey. With a delicacy surprising in \\nsuch a big man, he dabbed at the blood welling from her broken lip. \\nThe moment was gone. Sansa lowered her eyes. \"Thank you,\" she said when he was done. She was a \\ngood girl, and always remembered her courtesies. \\nDAENERYS \\nPage 510\\n\\nWings shadowed her fever dreams. \"You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" \\nShe was walking down a long hall beneath high stone arches. She could not look behind her, must not \\nlook behind her. There was a door ahead of her, tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it \\nwas painted red. She walked faster, and her bare feet left bloody footprints on the stone. \\n\"You don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" \\nShe saw sunlight on the Dothraki sea, the living plain, rich with the smells of earth and death. Wind \\nstirred the grasses, and they rippled like water. Drogo held her in strong arms, and his hand stroked her \\nsex and opened her and woke that sweet wetness that was his alone, and the stars smiled down on them, \\nstars in a daylight sky. \"Home,\" she whispered as he entered her and filled her with his seed, but suddenly \\nthe stars were gone, and across the blue sky swept the great wings, and the world took flame. \\n\". . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" \\nSer Jorah\\'s face was drawn and sorrowful. \"Rhaegar was the last dragon,\" he told her. He warmed \\ntranslucent hands over a glowing brazier where stone eggs smouldered red as coals. One moment he was \\nthere and the next he was fading, his flesh colorless, less substantial than the wind. \"The last dragon,\" he \\nwhispered, thin as a wisp, and was \\ngone. She felt the dark behind her, and the red door seemed farther away than ever. \\n\". . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon, do you?\" \\nViserys stood before her, screaming. \"The dragon does not beg, slut. You do not command the dragon. \\nI am the dragon, and I will be crowned.\" The molten gold trickled down his face like wax, burning deep \\nchannels in his flesh. \"I am the dragon and I will be crowned!\" he shrieked, and his fingers snapped like \\nsnakes, biting at her nipples, pinching, twisting, even as his eyes burst and ran like jelly down seared and \\nblackened cheeks. \\nPage 511\\n\\n\". . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon \\nThe red door was so far ahead of her, and she could feel the icy breath behind, sweeping up on her. If it \\ncaught her she would die a death that was more than death, howling forever alone in the darkness. She \\nbegan to run. \\n\". . . don\\'t want to wake the dragon \\nShe could feel the heat inside her, a terrible burning in her womb. Her son was tall and proud, with \\nDrogo\\'s copper skin and her own silver-gold hair, violet eyes shaped like almonds. And he smiled for her \\nand began to lift his hand toward hers, but when he opened his mouth the fire poured out. She saw his \\nheart burning through his chest, and in an instant he was gone, consumed like a moth by a candle, turned \\nto ash. She wept for her child, the promise of a sweet mouth on her breast, but her tears turned to steam \\nas they touched her skin. \\n\". . . want to wake the dragon . . . \" \\nGhosts lined the hallway, dressed in the faded raiment of kings. In their hands were swords of pale fire. \\nThey had hair of silver and hair of gold and hair of platinum white, and their eyes were opal and amethyst, \\ntourmaline and jade. \"Faster,\" they cried, \"faster, faster.\" She raced, her feet melting the stone wherever \\nthey touched. \"Faster!\" the ghosts cried as one, and she screamed and threw herself forward. A great \\nknife of pain ripped down her back, and she felt her skin tear open and smelled the stench of burning \\nblood and saw the shadow of wings. And Daenerys Targaryen flew. \\nwake the dragon \\nThe door loomed before her, the red door, so close, so close, the hall was a blur around her, the cold \\nreceding behind. And now the stone was gone and she flew across the Dothraki sea, high and higher, the \\ngreen rippling beneath, and all that lived and breathed fled in terror from the shadow of her wings. She \\ncould smell home, she could see it, there, just beyond that door, green fields and great stone houses and \\narms to keep her warm, there. She threw open the door. \\nPage 512\\n\\n\"... the dragon . . . \" \\nAnd saw her brother Rhaegar, mounted on a stallion as black as his armor. Fire glimmered red through \\nthe narrow eye slit of his helm. \"The last dragon,\" Ser Jorah\\'s voice whispered faintly. \"The last, the last.\" \\nDany lifted his polished black visor. The face within was her own. \\nAfter that, for a long time, there was only the pain, the fire within her, and the whisperings of stars. \\nShe woke to the taste of ashes. \\n\"No,\" she moaned, \"no, please.\" \\n\"Khaleesi?\" Jhiqui hovered over her, a frightened doe. \\nThe tent was drenched in shadow, still and close. Flakes of ash drifted upward from a brazier, and Dany \\nfollowed them with her eyes through the smoke hole above. Flying, she thought. I had wings, I was flying. \\nBut it was only a dream. \"Help me,\" she whispered, struggling to rise. \"Bring me . . .\" Her voice was raw \\nas a wound, and she could not think what she wanted. Why did she hurt so much? It was as if her body \\nhad been torn to pieces and remade from the scraps. \"I want . . .\" \\n\"Yes, Khaleesi.\" Quick as that Jhiqui was gone, bolting from the tent, shouting. Dany needed . . . \\nsomething . . . someone . . . what? It was important, she knew. It was the only thing in the world that \\nmattered. She rolled onto her side and got an elbow under her, fighting the blanket tangled about her \\nlegs. It was so hard to move. The world swam dizzily. I have to . . . \\nThey found her on the carpet, crawling toward her dragon eggs. Ser Jorah Mormont lifted her in his \\narms and carried her back to her sleeping silks, while she struggled feebly against him. Over his shoulder \\nshe saw her three handmaids, Jhogo with his little wisp of mustache, and the flat broad face of Mirri Maz \\nDuur. \"I must,\" she tried to tell them, \"I have to . . .\" \\nPage 513\\n\\n. . . sleep, Princess,\" Ser Jorah said. No,\" Dany said. \"Please. Please.\" \\n\"Yes.\" He covered her with silk, though she was burning. \"Sleep and grow strong again, Khaleesi. Come \\nback to us.\" And then Mirri Maz Duur was there, the maegi, tipping a cup against her lips. She tasted \\nsour milk, and something else, something thick and bitter. Warm liquid ran down her chin. Somehow she \\nswallowed. The tent grew dimmer, and sleep took her again. This time she did not dream. She floated, \\nserene and at peace, on a black sea that knew no shore. \\nAfter a time-a night, a day, a year, she could not say-she woke again. The tent was dark, its silken walls \\nflapping like wings when the wind gusted outside. This time Dany did not attempt to rise. \"Irri,\" she \\ncalled, \"Jhiqui. Doreah.\" They were there at once. \"My throat is dry,\" she said, \"so dry,\" and they \\nbrought her water. It was warm and flat, yet Dany drank it eagerly, and sent Jhiqui for more. Irri \\ndampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow. \"I have been sick,\" Dany said. The Dothraki girl nodded. \\n\"How long?\" The cloth was soothing, but Irri seemed so sad, it frightened her. \\'Eong, \" she whispered. \\nWhen Jhiqui returned with more water, Mirri Maz Duur came with her, eyes heavy from sleep. \"Drink,\" \\nshe said, lifting Dany\\'s head to the cup once more, but this time it was only wine. Sweet, sweet wine. \\nDany drank, and lay back, listening to the soft sound of her own breathing. She could feel the heaviness \\nin her limbs, as sleep crept in to fill her up once more. \"Bring me . . .\" she murmured, her voice slurred \\nand drowsy. \"Bring . . . I want to hold . . .\" \\n\"Yes?\" the maegi asked. \"What is it you wish, Khaleesi?\" \\n\"Bring me . . . egg . . . dragon\\'s egg . . . please . . .\" Her lashes turned to lead, and she was too weary to \\nhold them up. \\nWhen she woke the third time, a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through the smoke hole of the tent, \\nand her arms were wrapped around a dragon\\'s egg. It was the pale one, its scales the color of butter \\ncream, veined with whorls of gold and bronze, and Dany could feel the heat of it. Beneath her bedsilks, a \\nfine sheen of perspiration covered her bare skin. Dragondew, she thought. Her fingers trailed lightly \\nacross the surface of the shell, tracing the wisps of gold, and deep in the stone she felt something twist \\nand stretch in response. It did not frighten her. All her fear was gone, burned away. \\nPage 514\\n\\nDany touched her brow. Under the film of sweat, her skin was cool to the touch, her fever gone. She \\nmade herself sit. There was a moment of dizziness, and the deep ache between her thighs. Yet she felt \\nstrong. Her maids came running at the sound of her voice. \"Water,\" she told them, \"a flagon of water, \\ncold as you can find it. And fruit, I think. Dates.\" \\n\"As you say, Khaleesi.\" \\n\"I want Ser Jorah,\" she said, standing. Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and draped it over her shoulders. \\n\"And a warm bath, and Mirri Maz Duur, and . . .\" Memory came back to her all at once, and she \\nfaltered. \"Khal Drogo,\" she forced herself to say, watching their faces with dread. \"Is he-T\\' \\n\"The khal lives,\" Irri answered quietly . . . yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes when she said the words, \\nand no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to fetch water. \\nShe turned to Doreah. \"Tell me.\" \\nA ... I shall bring Ser Jorah,\" the Lysene girl said, bowing her head and fleeing the tent. \\nJhiqui would have run as well, but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her captive. \"What is it? I must \\nknow. Drogo . . . and my child.\" Why had she not remembered the child until now? \"My son . . . Rhaego \\n. . . where is he? I want him.\" \\nHer handmaid lowered her eyes. \"The boy . . . he did not live, Khaleesi.\" Her voice was a frightened \\nwhisper. \\nDany released her wrist. My son is dead, she thought as Jhiqui left the tent. She had known somehow. \\nShe had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui\\'s tears. No, she had known before she woke. Her \\ndream came back to her, sudden and vivid, and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and \\nlong silver-gold braid, bursting into flame. \\nPage 515\\n\\nShe should weep, she knew, yet her eyes were dry as ash. She had wept in her dream, and the tears \\nhad turned to steam on her cheeks. All the grief has been burned out of me, she told herself. She felt sad, \\nand yet . . . she could feel Rhaego receding from her, as if he had never been. \\nSer Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany standing over the other \\ndragon\\'s eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her that they felt as hot as the one she had slept \\nwith, which was passing strange. \"Ser Jorah, come here,\" she said. She took his hand and placed it on \\nthe black egg with the scarlet swirls. \"What do you feel?\" \\n\"Shell, hard as rock.\" The knight was wary. \"Scales.\" \\n\"Heat?\" \\n\"No. Cold stone.\" He took his hand away. \"Princess, are you well? Should you be up, weak as you \\nare?\" \\n\"Weak? I am strong, Jorah.\" To please him, she reclined on a pile of cushions. \"Tell me how my child \\ndied.\" \\n\"He never lived, my princess. The women say He faltered, and Dany saw how the flesh hung loose on \\nhim, and the way he limped when he moved. \\n\"Tell me. Tell me what the women say.\" \\nHe turned his face away. His eyes were haunted. \"They say the child was . . .\" \\nShe waited, but Ser Jorah could not say it. His face grew dark with shame. He looked half a corpse \\nhimself. \\nPage 516\\n\\n\"Monstrous,\" Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful man, yet Dany understood in \\nthat moment that the maegi was stronger, and crueler, and infinitely more dangerous. \"Twisted. I drew \\nhim forth myself. He was scaled like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the \\nwings of a bat. When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of \\ngraveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years.\" \\nDarkness, Dany thought. The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour her. If she looked back \\nshe was lost. \"My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah carried me into this tent,\" she said. \"I could \\nfeel him kicking, fighting to be born.\" \\n\"That may be as it may be,\" answered Mirri Maz Duur, \"yet the creature that came forth from your \\nwomb was as I said. Death was in that tent, Khaleesi.\" \\n\"Only shadows,\" Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in his voice. \"I saw, maegi. I saw \\nyou, alone, dancing with the shadows. \" \\n\"The grave casts long shadows, Iron Lord,\" Mirri said. \"Long and dark, and in the end no light can hold \\nthem back.\" \\nSer Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew. He had done what he did for love and loyalty, yet he had \\ncarried her into a place no living man should go and fed her baby to the darkness. He knew it too; the \\ngrey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. \"The shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah,\" she told him. The \\nknight made no reply. Dany turned to the godswife. \"You warned me that only death could pay for life. I \\nthought you meant the horse.\" \\n\"No,\" Mirri Maz Duur said. \"That was a lie you told yourself. You knew the price.\" \\nHad she? Had she? If I look back I am lost. \"The price was paid,\" Dany said. \"The horse, my child, \\nQuaro and Qotho, Haggo and Cohollo. The price was paid and paid and paid.\" She rose from her \\ncushions. \"Where is Khal Drogo? Show him to me, godswife, maegi, bloodmage, whatever you are. \\nPage 517\\n\\nShow me Khal Drogo. Show me what I bought with my son\\'s life.\" \\n\"As you command, Khaleesi,\" the old woman said. \"Come, I will take you to him.\" \\nDany was weaker than she knew. Ser Jorah slipped an arm around her and helped her stand. \"Time \\nenough for this later, my princess,\" he said quietly. \\n\"I would see him now, Ser Jorah.\" \\nAfter the dimness of the tent, the world outside was blinding bright. The sun burned like molten gold, and \\nthe land was seared and empty. Her handmaids waited with fruit and wine and water, and Jhogo moved \\nclose to help Ser Jorah support her. Aggo and Rakharo stood behind. The glare of sun on sand made it \\nhard to see more, until Dany \\nraised her hand to shade her eyes. She saw the ashes of a fire, a few score horses milling listlessly and \\nsearching for a bite of grass, a scattering of tents and bedrolls. A small crowd of children had gathered to \\nwatch her, and beyond she glimpsed women going about their work, and withered old men staring at the \\nflat blue sky with tired eyes, swatting feebly at bloodflies. A count might show a hundred people, no \\nmore. Where the other forty thousand had made their camp, only the wind and dust lived now. \\n\"Drogo\\'s khalasar is gone,\" she said. \\n\"A khal who cannot ride is no khal,\" said Jhogo. \\n\"The Dothraki follow only the strong,\" Ser Jorah said. \"I am sorry, my princess. There was no way to \\nhold them. Ko Pono left first, naming himself Khal Pono, and many followed him. Jhaqo was not long to \\ndo the same. The rest slipped away night by night, in large bands and small. There are a dozen new \\nkhalasars on the Dothraki sea, where once there was only Drogo\\'s.\" \\nPage 518\\n\\n\"The old remain,\" said Aggo. \"The frightened, the weak, and the sick. And we who swore. We remain.\" \\n\"They took Khal Drogo\\'s herds, Khaleesi,\" Rakharo said. \"We were too few to stop them. It is the right \\nof the strong to take from the weak. They took many slaves as well, the khal\\'s and yours, yet they left \\nsome few.\" \\n\"Eroeh?\" asked Dany, remembering the frightened child she had saved outside the city of the Lamb \\nMen. \\n\"Mago seized her, who is Khal Jhaqo\\'s bloodrider now,\" said Jhogo. \"He mounted her high and low and \\ngave her to his khal, and Jhaqo gave her to his other bloodriders. They were six. When they were done \\nwith her, they cut her throat.\" \\n\"It was her fate, Khaleesi,\" said Aggo. \\nIf I look back I am lost. \"It was a cruel fate,\" Dany said, \"yet not so cruel as Mago\\'s will be. I promise \\nyou that, by the old gods and the new, by the lamb god and the horse god and every god that lives. I \\nswear it by the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World. Before I am done with them, Mago \\nand Ko Jhaqo will plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh.\" \\nThe Dothraki exchanged uncertain glances. \"Khaleesi, \" the handmaid Irri explained, as if to a child, \\n\"Jhaqo is a khal now, with twenty thousand riders at his back.\" \\nShe lifted her head. \"And I am Daenerys Stormhorn, Daenerys of House Targaryen, of the blood of \\nAegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old Valyria before them. I am the dragon\\'s daughter, \\nand I swear to you, these men will die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.\" \\nHe was lying on the bare red earth, staring up at the sun. \\nPage 519\\n\\nA dozen bloodflies had settled on his body, though he did not seem to feel them. Dany brushed them \\naway and knelt beside him. His eyes were wide open but did not see, and she knew at once that he was \\nblind. When she whispered his name, he did not seem to hear. The wound on his breast was as healed as \\nit would ever be, the scar that covered it grey and red and hideous. \\n\"Why is he out here alone, in the sun?\" she asked them. \\n\"He seems to like the warmth, Princess,\" Ser Jorah said. \"His eyes follow the sun, though he does not \\nsee it. He can walk after a fashion. He will go where you lead him, but no farther. He will eat if you put \\nfood in his mouth, drink if you dribble water on his lips.\" \\nDany kissed her sun-and-stars gently on the brow, and stood to face Mirri Maz Duur. \"Your spells are \\ncostly, maegi.\" \\n\"He lives,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"You asked for life. You paid for life.\" \\n\"This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was. His life was laughter, and meat roasting over a firepit, \\nand a horse between his legs. His life was an arakh in his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode \\nto meet an enemy. His life was his bloodriders, and me, and the son I was to give him.\" \\nMirri Maz Duur made no reply. \\n\"When will he be as he was?\" Dany demanded. \\n\"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" said Mirri Maz Duur. \"When the seas go dry and \\nmountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. \\nThen he will return, and not before.\" \\nDany gestured at Ser Jorah and the others. \"Leave us. I would speak with this maegi alone.\" Mormont \\nand the Dothraki withdrew. \"You knew,\" Dany said when they were gone. She ached, inside and out, but \\nPage 520\\n\\nher fury gave her strength. \"You* knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me \\npay it.\" \\n\"It was wrong of them to burn my temple,\" the heavy, flat-nosed woman said placidly. \"That angered the \\nGreat Shepherd.\" \\n\"This was no god\\'s work,\" Dany said coldly. If I look back I am lost. \"You cheated me. You murdered \\nmy child within me.\" \\n\"The stallion who mounts the world will burn no cities now. His khalasar shall trample no nations into \\ndusU, \\n\"I spoke for you,\" she said, anguished. \"I saved you.\" \\n\"Saved me?\" The Lhazareen woman spat. \"Three riders had taken \\nme, not as a man takes a woman but from behind, as a dog takes a bitch. The fourth was in me when \\nyou rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god\\'s house burn, where I had healed good men \\nbeyond counting. My home they burned as well, and in the street I saw piles of heads. I saw the head of \\na baker who made my bread. I saw the head of a boy I had saved from deadeye fever, only three moons \\npast. I heard children crying as the riders drove them off with their whips. Tell me again what you saved.\" \\n\"Your life.\" \\nMirri Maz Duur laughed cruelly. \"Look to your khal and see what life is worth, when all the rest is gone.\" \\nDany called out for the men of her khas and bid them take Mirri Maz Duur and bind her hand and foot, \\nbut the maegi smiled at her as they carried her off, as if they shared a secret. A word, and Dany could \\nhave her head off . . . yet then what would she have? A head? If life was worthless, what was death? \\nPage 521\\n\\nThey led Khal Drogo back to her tent, and Dany commanded them to fill a tub, and this time there was \\nno blood in the water. She bathed him herself, washing the dirt and the dust from his arms and chest, \\ncleaning his face with a soft cloth, soaping his long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from it \\ntill it shone again as she remembered. It was well past dark before she was done, and Dany was \\nexhausted. She stopped for drink and food, but it was all she could do to nibble at a fig and keep down a \\nmouthful of water. Sleep would have been a release, but she had slept enough . . . too long, in truth. She \\nowed this night to Drogo, for all the nights that had been, and yet might be. \\nThe memory of their first ride was with her when she led him out into the darkness, for the Dothraki \\nbelieved that all things of importance in a man\\'s life must be done beneath the open sky. She told herself \\nthat there were powers stronger than hatred, and spells older and truer than any the maegi had learned in \\nAsshai. The night was black and moonless, but overhead a million stars burned bright. She took that for \\nan omen. \\nNo soft blanket of grass welcomed them here, only the hard dusty ground, bare and strewn with stones. \\nNo trees stirred in the wind, and there was no stream to soothe her fears with the gentle music of water. \\nDany told herself that the stars would be enough. \"Remember, Drogo,\" she whispered. \"Remember our \\nfirst ride together, the day we wed. Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the khalasar all around \\nus and your eyes on my face. Remember how cool and clean \\nthe water was in the Womb of the World. Remember, my sun-andstars. Remember, and come back to \\nme.\" \\nThe birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her, as she would have wanted, but Doreah \\nhad taught her other ways. Dany used her hands, her mouth, her breasts. She raked him with her nails \\nand covered him with kisses and whispered and prayed and told him stories, and by the end she had \\nbathed him with her tears. Yet Drogo did not feel, or speak, or rise. \\nAnd when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that he was truly lost to her. \\n\"When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,\" she said sadly. \"When the seas go dry and \\nmountains blow in the wind like leaves. When my womb quickens again, and I bear a living child. Then \\nyou will return, my sun-and-stars, and not before.\" \\nPage 522\\n\\nNever, the darkness cried, never never never. \\nInside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She clutched it to her breasts as she \\nwalked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. If I look back I am lost. It hurt even to walk, and she \\nwanted to sleep, to sleep and not to dream. \\nShe knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his face. \\nTYRION \\nThey have my son,\" Tywin Lannister said. \\n\"They do, my lord.\" The messenger\\'s voice was dulled by \"Texhaustion. On the breast of his torn \\nsurcoat, the brindled boar of Crakehall was half-obscured by dried blood. \\nOne of your sons, Tyrion thought. He took a sip of wine and said not a word, thinking of Jaime. When \\nhe lifted his arm, pain shot through his elbow, reminding him of his own brief taste of battle. He loved his \\nbrother, but he would not have wanted to be with him in the Whispering Wood for all the gold in Casterly \\nRock. \\nHis lord father\\'s assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as the courier told his tale. The \\nonly sound was the crackle and hiss of the log burning in the hearth at the end of the long, drafty common \\nroom. \\nAfter the hardships of the long relentless drive south, the prospect of even a single night in an inn had \\ncheered Tyrion mightily . . . though he rather wished it had not been this inn again, with all its memories. \\nHis father had set a grueling pace, and it had taken its toll. Men wounded in the battle kept up as best \\nthey could or were abandoned to fend for themselves. Every morning they left a few more by the \\nroadside, men who went to sleep never to wake. Every afternoon a few more collapsed along the way. \\nAnd every evening a few more \\nPage 523\\n\\ndeserted, stealing off into the dusk. Tyrion had been half-tempted to go with them. \\nHe had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of Shae\\'s body beside him, \\nwhen his squire had woken him to say that a rider had arrived with dire news of Riverrun. So it had all \\nbeen for nothing. The rush south, the endless forced marches, the bodies left beside the road . . . all for \\nnaught. Robb Stark had reached Riverrun days and days ago. \\n\"How could this happen?\" Ser Harys Swyft moaned. \"How? Even after the Whispering Wood, you had \\nRiverrun ringed in iron, surrounded by a great host . . . what madness made Ser Jaime decide to split his \\nmen into three separate camps? Surely he knew how vulnerable that would leave them?\" \\nBetter than you, you chinless craven, Tyrion thought. Jaime might have lost Riverrun, but it angered him \\nto hear his brother slandered by the likes of Swyft, a shameless lickspittle whose greatest \\naccomplishment was marrying his equally chinless daughter to Ser Kevan, and thereby attaching himself \\nto the Lannisters. \\n\"I would have done the same,\" his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly than Tyrion might have. \\n\"You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would know that Jaime had little choice in the matter. \\nThe castle is situated at the end of the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of \\nthe Trident. The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open their \\nsluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun into an island. The walls \\nrise sheer from the water, and from their towers the defenders have a commanding view of the opposite \\nshores for many leagues around. To cut off all the approaches, a besieger must needs place one camp \\nnorth of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west of the moat. \\nThere is no other way, none.\" \\n\"Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,\" the courier said. \"We\\'d built palisades of sharpened stakes around \\nthe camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and the rivers cutting us off from each other. They \\ncame down on the north camp first. No one was expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our \\nsupply trains, but he had no more than fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night \\nbefore . . . well, with what we thought was them. We were told the Stark host was east of the Green \\nFork, marching south . . .\" \\n\"And your outriders?\" Ser Gregor Clegane\\'s face might have been hewn from rock. The fire in the hearth \\nPage 524\\n\\ngave a somber orange cast to \\nhis skin and put deep shadows in the hollows of his eyes. \"They saw nothing? They gave you no \\nwarning?\" \\nThe bloodstained messenger shook his head. \"Our outriders had been vanishing. Marq Piper\\'s work, we \\nthought. The ones who did come back had seen nothing.\" \\n\"A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,\" the Mountain declared. \"Cut them out and give them \\nto your next outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes might see better than two . . . and if not, the man \\nafter him will have six.\" \\nLord Tywin Lannister turned his face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a glimmer of gold as the light \\nshone off his father\\'s pupils, but he could not have said whether the look was one of approval or disgust. \\nLord Tywin was oft quiet in council, preferring to listen before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to \\nemulate. Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was untouched. \\n\"You said they came at night,\" Ser Kevan prompted. \\nThe man gave a weary nod. \"The Blacklish led the van, cutting down our sentries and clearing away the \\npalisades for the main assault. By the time our men knew what was happening, riders were pouring over \\nthe ditch banks and galloping through the camp with swords and torches in hand. I was sleeping in the \\nwest camp, between the rivers. When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord Brax led \\nus to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us downstream and the Tullys started \\nflinging rocks at us with the catapults on their walls. I saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others \\noverturned, men swept into the river and drowned . . . and those who did make it across found the \\nStarks waiting for them on the riverbanks.\" \\nSer Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who cannot comprehend what \\nhe has just heard. \"My lord father-\" \\nPage 525\\n\\n\"Sorry, my lord,\" the messenger said. \"Lord Brax was clad in plateand-mail when his raft overturned. He \\nwas very gallant.\" \\nHe was a fool, Tyrion thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the winy depths. Crossing a river at \\nnight on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an enemy waiting on the other side-if that was gallantry, he \\nwould take cowardice every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of \\nhis steel pulled him under the black water. \\n\"The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,\" the messenger was saying. \"While we were trying to \\ncross, more Starks swept in from the west, two columns of armored horse. I saw Lord Umber\\'s giant-in \\nchains and the Mallister eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his \\nside. I wasn\\'t there to see, but it\\'s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen horses. Our \\nspearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but when the Tullys saw them \\nengaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge \\nand took them in the rear.\" \\n\"Gods save us,\" Lord Lefford swore. \\n\"Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully \\nin chains among the other captives, and made off with them all. Our south camp was under the command \\nof Ser Forley Prester. He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two \\nthousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his freeriders struck his \\nbanners and went over to the foe.\" \\n\"Curse the man.\" His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. \"I warned Jaime not to trust that \\none. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his purse.\" \\nLord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as he listened. His bristling \\ngolden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of \\nsweat dappling his father\\'s shaven head. \\nPage 526\\n\\n\"How could it happen?\" Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. \"Ser Jaime taken, the siege broken . . . this is a \\ncatastrophe!\" \\nSer Addarn Marbrand said, \"I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing out the obvious, Ser Harys. \\nThe question is, what shall we do about it?\" \\n\"What can we do? Jaime\\'s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and the Starks and the Tullys \\nsit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from the west! They can march on Casterly Rock if \\nthey so choose, and what\\'s to stop them? My lords, we are beaten. We must sue for peace.\" \\n\"Peace?\" Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled his empty cup to the floor, \\nwhere it shattered into a thousand pieces. \"There\\'s your peace, Ser Harys. My sweet nephew broke it \\nfor good and all when he decided to ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard\\'s head. You\\'ll have an \\neasier time drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace now. He\\'s \\nwinning . . . or hadn\\'t you noticed?\" \\n\"Two battles do not make a war,\" Ser Addam insisted. \"We are far from lost. I should welcome the \\nchance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.\" \\n\"Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for theirs,\" offered Lord \\nLefford. \\n\"Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,\" Tyrion said acidly. \"And what \\nare we to offer for my brother? Lord Eddard\\'s rotting head?\" \\n\"I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand\\'s daughters,\" Lefford said hopefully. \"If we give the lad his \\nsisters back . . .\" \\nSer Addam snorted disdainfully. \"He would have to be an utter ass to trade Jaime Lannister\\'s life for two \\ngirls.\" \\nPage 527\\n\\n\"Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,\" Lord Lefford said. \\nTyrion rolled his eyes. \"If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt down Jaime\\'s armor.\" \\n\"if we ask for a truce, they will think us weak,\" Ser Addarn argued. \"We should march on them at once.\" \\n\"Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh troops,\" said Ser Harys. \"And \\nsomeone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new host.\" \\nLord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. \"They have my son, \" he said once more, in a voice that cut \\nthrough the babble like a sword through suet. \"Leave me. All of you.\" \\nEver the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father gave him a look. \"Not you, \\nTyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of you, out.\" \\nTyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser Kevan crossed the room to \\nthe wine casks. \"Uncle,\" Tyrion called, \"if you would be so kind-\" \\n\"Here.\" His father offered him his cup, the wine untouched. \\nNow Tyrion truly was nonplussed. He drank. \\nLord Tywin seated himself. \"You have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we might have used Lord \\nEddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a peace that would have given us the time we need \\nto deal with Robert\\'s brothers. Dead His hand curled into a fist. \"Madness. Rank madness.\" \\n\"Joff\\'s only a boy,\" Tyrion pointed out. \"At his age, I committed a few follies of my own.\" \\nPage 528\\n\\nHis father gave him a sharp look. \"I suppose we ought to be grateful that he has not yet married a \\nwhore.\" \\nTyrion sipped at his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung the cup in his face. \\n\"Our position is worse than you know,\" his father went on. \"It would seem we have a new king.\" \\nSer Kevan looked poleaxed. \"A new-who? What have they done to Joffrey?\" \\nThe faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin\\'s thin lips. \"Nothing . . . yet. My grandson still \\nsits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard whispers from the south. Renly Baratheon wed Margaery \\nTyrell at Highgarden this fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown. The bride\\'s father and \\nbrothers have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.\" \\n\"Those are grave tidings.\" When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow grew deep as canyons. \\n\"My daughter commands us to ride for King\\'s Landing at once, to defend the Red Keep against King \\nRenly and the Knight of Flowers.\" His mouth tightened. \"Commands us, mind you. In the name of the \\nking and council.\" \\n\"How is King Joffrey taking the news?\" Tyrion asked with a certain black amusement. \\n\"Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,\" Lord Tywin said. \"She fears he might insist on marching against \\nRenly himself.\" \\n\"With what army?\" Tyrion asked. \"You don\\'t plan to give him this one, I hope?\" \\nPage 529\\n\\n\"He talks of leading the City Watch,\" Lord Tywin said. \\n\"If he takes the Watch, he\\'ll leave the city undefended,\" Ser Kevan said. \"And with Lord Stannis on \\nDragonstone . . .\" \\n\"Yes.\" Lord Tywin looked down at his son. \"I had thought you were the one made for motley, Tyrion, \\nbut it would appear that I was wrong.\" \\n\"Why, Father,\" said Tyrion, \"that almost sounds like praise.\" He leaned forward intently. \"What of \\nStannis? He\\'s the elder, not Renly. How does he feel about his brother\\'s claim?\" \\nHis father frowned. \"I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater danger than all the others \\ncombined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring \\nsellswords, Stannis is bringing a shadowbinder from Asshai. What does it mean? Is any of it true?\" He \\ngave an irritated shrug. \"Kevan, bring us the map.\" \\nSer Kevan did as he was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing it flat. \"Jaime has left us in a \\nbad way. Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are north of us. Our enemies hold the Twins and \\nMoat Cailin. Robb Stark sits to the west, so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we \\nchoose to give battle. Jaime is taken, and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist. Thoros of Myr \\nand Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties. To our \\neast we have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south Highgarden and \\nStorm\\'s End are calling their banners.\" \\nTyrion smiled crookedly. \"Take heart, Father. At least Rhaegar Targaryen is still dead.\" \\n\"I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,\" Lord Tywin Lannister said. \\nPage 530\\n\\nSer Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing. \"Robb Stark will have Edmure Tully and the lords \\nof the Trident with him now. Their combined power may exceed our own. And with Roose Bolton \\nbehind us . . . Tywin, if we remain here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.\" \\n\"I have no intention of remaining here. We must finish our business with young Lord Stark before Renly \\nBaratheon can march from Highgarden. Bolton does not concern me. He is a wary man, and we made \\nhim warier on the Green Fork. He will be slow to give pursuit. So . . . on the morrow, we make for \\nHarrenhal. Kevan, I want Ser Addam\\'s outriders to screen our movements. Give him as many men as he \\nrequires, and send them out in groups of four. I will have no vanishings.\" \\n\"As you say, my lord, but . . . why Harrenhal? That is a grim, unlucky place. Some call it cursed.\" \\n\"Let them,\" Lord Tywin said. \"Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us with his reavers. Send forth \\nVargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory Lorch. Each is to have three hundred horse. Tell \\nthem I want to see the riverlands afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.\" \\n\"They will burn, my lord,\" Ser Kevan said, rising. \"I shall give the commands.\" He bowed and made for \\nthe door. \\nWhen they were alone, Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion. \"Your savages might relish a bit of rapine. Tell \\nthem they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they like-goods, stock, women, they may take what \\nthey want and burn the rest.\" \\n\"Telling Shagga and Timett how to pillage is like telling a rooster how to crow,\" Tyrion commented, \"but \\nI should prefer to keep them with me.\" Uncouth and unruly they might be, yet the wildlings were his, and \\nhe trusted them more than any of his father\\'s men. He was not about to hand them over. \\n\"Then you had best learn to control them. I will not have the city plundered.\" \\n\"The city?\" Tyrion was lost. \"What city would that be?\" \\nPage 531\\n\\n\"King\\'s Landing. I am sending you to court.\" \\nIt was the last thing Tyrion Lannister would ever have anticipated. \\nHe reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped. \"And what am I to do there?\" \\n\"Rule,\" his father said curtly \\nTyrion hooted with laughter. \"My sweet sister might have a word or two to say about that!\" \\n\"Let her say what she likes. Her son needs to be taken in hand before he ruins us all. I blame those \\njackanapes on the council-our friend Petyr, the venerable Grand Maester, and that cockless wonder \\nLord Varys. What sort of counsel are they giving Joffrey when he lurches from one folly to the next? \\nWhose notion was it to make this Janos Slynt a lord? The man\\'s father was a butcher, and they grant him \\nHarrenhal. Harrenhal, that was the seat of kings! Not that he will ever set foot inside it, if I have a say. I \\nam told he took a bloody spear for his sigil. A bloody cleaver would have been my choice.\" His father \\nhad not raised his voice, yet \\'I~rion could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. \"And dismissing Selmy, \\nwhere was the sense in that? Yes, the man was old, but the name of Barristan the Bold still has meaning \\nin the realm. He lent honor to any man he served. Can anyone say the same of the Hound? You feed \\nyour dog bones under the table, you do not seat him beside you on the high bench.\" He pointed a finger \\nat Tyrion\\'s face. \"If Cersei cannot curb the boy, you must. And if these councillors are playing us false . . \\n.\" \\nTyrion knew. \"Spikes,\" he sighed. \"Heads. Walls.\" \\n\"I see you have taken a few lessons from me.\" \\n\"More than you know, Father,\" Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set the cup aside, \\nthoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit. Another part was remembering the \\nbattle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again. \"Why me?\" he asked, cocking his \\nhead to one side. \"Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a . \\nPage 532\\n\\n. . bigger man?\" \\nLord Tywin rose abruptly. \"You are my son.\" \\nThat was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody bastard, you think \\nJaime\\'s good as dead, so I\\'m all you have left. \\'1~rion wanted to slap him, to spit in his face, to draw his \\ndagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said. \\nYet he sat there, silent and still. \\nThe shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father\\'s heels as Lord Tywin crossed the room. \\n\"One last thing,\" he said at the door. \"You will not take the whore to court.\" \\nTyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was gone. Finally he climbed the \\nsteps to his cozy garret beneath \\nthe bell tower. The ceiling was low, but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf. From the window, he \\ncould see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard. The innkeep\\'s body turned slowly on its rope \\nwhenever the night wind gusted. Her flesh had grown as thin and ragged as Lannister hopes. \\nShae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the featherbed. He slid his \\nhand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her eyes opened. \"M\\'lord,\" she said with a drowsy \\nsmile. \\nWhen he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed her. \"I have a mind to take you to King\\'s Landing, \\nsweetling,\" he whispered. \\nJON \\nPage 533\\n\\nThe mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch. \"Easy, sweet lady,\" he said in a soft voice, \\nquieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon \\npaid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. \"Ghost,\" he called \\nsoftly, \"to me.\" And the wolf was there, eyes like embers. \\n\"Jon, please. You must not do this.\" \\nHe mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood \\nin the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder. He threw a giant\\'s shadow, immense and black. \\n\"Get out of my way, Sam.\" \\n\"Jon, you can\\'t,\" Sam said. \"I won\\'t let you.\" \\n\"I would sooner not hurt you,\" Jon told him. \"Move aside, Sam, or I\\'ll ride you down.\" \\n\"You won\\'t. You have to listen to me. Please \\nJon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood his ground, \\nhis face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening 0 of surprise. At the last \\nmoment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and \\nfell. The mare leapt over him, out into the night. \\nJon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. \\nCastle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched from the \\nWall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one \\nbut Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn\\'t hurt himself, \\nfalling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his \\nankle getting out of the way. \"I warned him,\" Jon said aloud. \"It was nothing to do with him, anyway.\" He \\nflexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him, but it \\nPage 534\\n\\nfelt good to have the wrappings off. \\nMoonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He needed to get as far \\nfrom the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the morrow he would leave the road and \\nstrike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was \\nmore important than deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going. \\nThe Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he \\ncould between him and the Wall . . . if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily \\nfrightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but \\nJon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the Mng\\'s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep. \\nWhen Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear\\'s breakfast from the kitchen, they\\'d look in his cell and \\nfind Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it \\nwith him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont \\nwould find someone more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his \\ndesertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son\\'s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay \\nhim for his trust, but it couldn\\'t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying \\nsomeone. \\nEven now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it easier. They had \\ntheir septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods\\' will and help sort out right from wrong. But the \\nStarks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak. \\nWhen the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. He had a long \\njourney ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along \\nthe road south where he might be able to trade the mare \\nfor a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown. \\nHe would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he\\'d need to steal them. He was clad in black from \\nhead to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy \\nwool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his \\nPage 535\\n\\nsaddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing \\nblack was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would \\nsoon be watching for him. Once Maester Aemon\\'s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe \\nhaven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He \\nwould bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all. \\nYet he saw the castle clear in his mind\\'s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, \\nthe Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father\\'s solar, the turret room \\nwhere he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of \\nGage\\'s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the \\nFool. \\nBut he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father\\'s son, and Robb\\'s \\nbrother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was \\nhe Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but \\nthat was him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak \\nand craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about \\nthe pain of choosing; he understood that all too well. \\nTyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was \\ndone with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and \\ndamned. For the rest of his life-however long that might be-he would be condemned to be an outsider, \\nthe silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go \\nthroughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man\\'s hand be raised against him. \\nBut it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother\\'s side and help \\navenge his father. \\nHe remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair. \\nJon would have to come to him \\nin secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb\\'s face when he revealed himself. His brother \\nwould shake his head and smile, and he\\'d say ... he\\'d say ... \\nHe could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself thinking of the \\ndeserter his father had beheaded the day they\\'d found the direwolves. \"You said the words,\" Lord \\nPage 536\\n\\nEddard had told him. \"You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new.\" \\nDesmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump. Bran\\'s eyes had been wide as saucers, and \\nJon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father\\'s face when Theon \\nGreyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it \\ncame rolling at his feet. \\nHe wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of \\nthat ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely . . . and Robb would \\nwelcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or else . . . \\nIt did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins. Jon put his \\nheels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon \\nwas not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a \\ncommon brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father\\'s killers. He was \\nno true Stark, had never been one . . . but he could die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had \\nfathered four sons, not three. \\nGhost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth. Man and horse alike \\nlowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes \\nglowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace. \\nScattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole\\'s Town. A dog \\nbarked as he rode through, and he heard a mule\\'s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village \\nwas still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between \\nwooden slats, but only a few. \\nMole\\'s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm \\ncellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but \\na wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he\\'d heard \\nmen call the whores \"buried treasures.\" He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down \\nA GAME OF \\'FHRONES 679 \\nthere tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care. \\nPage 537\\n\\nNot until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the mare were damp \\nwith sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank of melting snow lay under the \\ntrees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his \\nhands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and \\nsplashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in \\ndays, and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad? \\nThe horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road was scarcely \\nwide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone. That \\nrun had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was \\nhe in such a great rush to die? \\nOff in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His mare whinnied \\nnervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth. \"Ghost!\" he shouted. \\n\"Ghost, to me.\" The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight. \\nFrowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry. Ghost did not \\nappear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf. \"Ghost, \" \\nhe called again. \"Where are you? To me! Ghost!\" Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even \\na half-grown direwolf, unless . . . no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack \\nanywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling. \\nHe should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up. There \\nwas no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a \\nsmall withered brown apple. He\\'d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he\\'d filched from the \\nkitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he\\'d need to hunt, and that would \\nslow him. \\nJon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad. He kept \\nthe apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core \\nwhen he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. \\nCould he outrun them? No, they were too close, they\\'d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from \\nCastle Black . . . \\nHe led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. \"Ouiet now,\" he said in a \\nPage 538\\n\\nhushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass \\nby. Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole\\'s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, \\nalthough what they were doing out in the middle of the night . . . \\nHe listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad. \\nFrom the sound, there were five or six of them at the least. Their voices drifted through the trees. \\n\". . . certain he came this way?\". \\n\"We can\\'t be certain.\" \\n\"He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through the woods. That\\'s what I\\'d \\ndo.\" \\n\"In the dark? Stupid. If you didn\\'t fall off your horse and break your neck, you\\'d get lost and wind up \\nback at the Wall when the sun came up. \\n\"I would not.\" Grenn sounded peeved. \"I\\'d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.\" \\n\"What if the sky was cloudy?\" Pyp asked. \\n\"Then I wouldn\\'t go.\" \\nAnother voice broke in. \"You know where Id be if it was me? I\\'d be in Mole\\'s Town, digging for buried \\ntreasure.\" Toad\\'s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon\\'s mare snorted. \\n\"Keep quiet, all of you,\" Haider said. \"I thought I heard something.\" \\n\"Where? I didn\\'t hear anything.\" The horses stopped. \\nPage 539\\n\\n\"You can\\'t hear yourself fart.\" \\n\"I can too,\" Grenn insisted. \\n\"Quiet!\" \\nThey all fell silent, listening. Jon found himself holding his breath. Sam, he thought. He hadn\\'t gone to the \\nOld Bear, but he hadn\\'t gone to bed either, he\\'d woken the other boys. Damn them all. Come dawn, if \\nthey were not in their beds, they\\'d be named deserters too. What did they think they were doing? \\nThe hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of \\ntheir horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. \"What did you hear?\" \\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Haider admitted. \"A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but . . .\" \\n\"There\\'s nothing here.\" \\nOut of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees. Leaves rustled, and \\nGhost came bounding out of the \\nshadows, so suddenly that Jon\\'s mare started and gave a whinny. \"There!\" Halder shouted. \\n\"I heard it too!\" \\nPage 540\\n\\n\"Traitor,\" Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare\\'s head to slide off \\nthrough the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet. \\n\"Jon!\" Pyp shouted after him. \\n\"Pull up,\" Grenn said. \"You can\\'t outrun us all.\" \\nJon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. \"Get back. I don\\'t wish to hurt you, but I will if I \\nhave to.\" \\n\"One against seven?\" Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding him. \\n\"What do you want with me?\" Jon demanded. \\n\"We want to take you back where you belong,\" Pyp said. \\n\"I belong with my brother.\" \\n\"We\\'re your brothers now,\" Grenn said. \\n\"They\\'ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,\" Toad put in with a nervous laugh. \"This is so \\nstupid, it\\'s like something the Aurochs would do.\" \\n\"I would not,\" Grenn said. \"I\\'m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant them.\" \\n\"So did U\\' Jon told them. \"Don\\'t you understand? They murdered my father. It\\'s war, my brother Robb \\nis fighting in the riverlands-\" \\nPage 541\\n\\n\"We know,\" said Pyp solemnly. \"Sam told us everything.\" \\n\"We\\'re sorry about your father,\" Grenn said, \"but it doesn\\'t matter. Once you say the words, you can\\'t \\nleave, no matter what.\" \\n\"I have to,\" Jon said fervently. \\n\"You said the words,\" Pyp reminded him. \"Now my watch begins, you said it. It shall not end until my \\ndeath. \" \\n\"I shall live and die at my post, \" Grenn added, nodding. \\n\"You don\\'t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.\" He was angry now. Why couldn\\'t \\nthey let him go in peace? They were only making it harder. \\n\"I am the sword in the darkness, \" Halder intoned. \\n\"The watcher on the walls, \" piped Toad. \\nJon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, \"I am the \\nfire that bums against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the hom that wakes the sleepers, the shield \\nthat guards the realms of men. \" \\n\"Stay back,\" Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. \"I mean it, Pyp.\" They weren\\'t even wearing armor, \\nhe could cut them to pieces if he had to. \\nPage 542\\n\\nMatthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. \"Ipledge my life and honor to the Night\\'s Watch. \" \\nJon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him now, closing from every side. \\n\"For this night Halder trotted in from the left. \\n. . . and all the nights to come, \" finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon\\'s reins. \"So here are your \\nchoices. Kill me, or come back with me.\" \\nJon lifted his sword . . . and lowered it, helpless. \"Damn you,\" he said. \"Damn you all.\" \\n\"Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you\\'ll ride back peaceful?\" asked \\nHalder. \\n\"I won\\'t run, if that\\'s what you mean.\" Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him. \\n\"Small help you were,\" he said. The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly. \\n\"We had best hurry,\" Pyp said. \"If we\\'re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.\" \\nOf the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps \\nbecause his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into \\nanother gallop. Mole\\'s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished. They \\nmade good time. Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of \\nthem, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall. It did not seem like home this time. \\nThey could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war would not end \\non the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night. He would bide his \\ntime, make them think he was content to remain here . . . and then, when they had grown lax, he would \\nbe off again. Next time he would avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way \\nto the sea, a longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high \\npasses. That was the wildling\\'s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid follow him. He wouldn\\'t \\nstray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad. \\nPage 543\\n\\nSamwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious \\nto sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. \"I . . . I\\'m glad they found you, Jon.\" \\n11IPm not,\" Jon said, dismounting. \\nPyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. \"Give us a hand bedding down \\nthe horses, Sam,\" the small boy \\nsaid. \"We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.\" \\nWhen day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as \\nhe gave him the Old Bear\\'s breakfast. Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and \\nham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. Jon carried the food back to the King\\'s Tower. He found \\nMormont at the window seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, \\nmuttering, \"Corn, corn, corn. \" The bird shrieked when Jon entered. \"Put the food on the table,\" the Old \\nBear said, glancing up. \"I\\'ll have some beer.\" \\nJon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn. Hobb \\nhad given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his \\nfingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth. \\n\"Doubtless you loved your father,\" Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. \"The things we love \\ndestroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?\" \\n\"I remember,\" Jon said sullenly. He did not care to talk of his father\\'s death, not even to Mormont. \\n\"See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch me my plate. Is it ham \\nagain? So be it. You look weary. Was your moonlight ride so tiring?\" \\nPage 544\\n\\nJon\\'s throat was dry. \"You know?\" \\n\"Know, \" the raven echoed from Mormont\\'s shoulder. \"Know. \\nThe Old Bear snorted. \"Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night\\'s Watch because \\nI\\'m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you\\'d go. I told him you\\'d be back. I know my men . . . \\nand my boys too. Honor set you on the kingsroad . . . and honor brought you back.\" \\n\"My friends brought me back,\" Jon said. \\n\"Did I say it was your honor?\" Mormont inspected his plate. \\n\"They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?\" \\n\"If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.\" Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit. \"I \\nordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If your brothers had not fetched you back, you \\nwould have been taken along the way, and not by friends. Unless you have a horse with wings like a \\nraven. Do you?\" \\n\"No.\" Jon felt like a fool. \\n\"Pity, we could use a horse like that.\" \\nJon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he \\nPage 545\\n\\ncould do, at the least. \"I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I\\'m not afraid to die.\" \\n\"Die!\" the raven cried. \\n\"Nor live, I hope,\" Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird. \"You have \\nnot deserted-yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole\\'s Town in the night, only \\nghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. \\nIs that it? Is that your hope, boy?\" \\nJon kept silent. \\n\"I thought so.\" Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. \"Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you \\ncan bring him back?\" \\n\"No,\" he answered, sullen. \\n\"Good,\" Mormont said. \"We\\'ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it\\'s not something I care to \\nsee again.\" He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth. \"Your brother \\nis in the field with all the power of the north behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more \\nswords than you\\'ll find in all the Night\\'s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you \\nsuch a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?\" \\nJon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak \\nthrough the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke. \\nThe Old Bear sighed. \"You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, my sister is marching \\nin your brother\\'s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men\\'s mail. Maege is a hoary old \\nsnark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched \\nwoman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.\" \\nFrowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. \"Or perhaps it \\ndoes. Be that as it may, I\\'d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don\\'t see me running off. I said the words, \\njust as you did. My place is here . . . where is yours, boy?\" \\nPage 546\\n\\nI have no place, Jon wanted to say, I\\'m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not \\neven a father. The words would not come. \"I don\\'t know.\" \\n\"I do,\" said Lord Commander Mormont. \"The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the Wall, the \\nshadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and \\nmammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from \\nEastwatch. Rangers from the \\nShadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the \\nmountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the \\nGorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold \\nhe\\'s found, to what end the gods only know. Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we\\'ve \\nlost this past year?\" \\n\"Ben Jen, \" the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. \"Ben Jen. Ben \\nJen. \" \\n\"No,\" Jon said. There had been others. Too many. \\n\"Do you think your brother\\'s war is more important than ours?\" the old man barked. \\nJon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. \"War, war, war, war, \" it sang. \\n\"It\\'s not,\" Mormont told him. \"Gods save us, boy, you\\'re not blind and you\\'re not stupid. When dead \\nmen come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?\" \\n\"No.\" Jon had not thought of it that way. \\n\"Your lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?\" \\nPage 547\\n\\n\"\"y? Why? Why?\" the raven called. \\n\"All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the \\nWall, and it\\'s said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours . . . he led us to the \\nwights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, \\nyet Ser Jaremy is dead and I\\'m not.\" Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. \\n\"I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond \\nthe Wall.\" \\nHis words sent a chill of excitement down Jon\\'s back. \"Beyond the Wall?\" \\n\"You heard me. I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead.\" He chewed and swallowed. \"I will not sit here \\nmeekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds. We must know what is happening. This time the \\nNight\\'s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that \\nmay be out there. I mean to command them myself.\" He pointed his dagger at Jon\\'s chest. \"By custom, \\nthe Lord Commander\\'s steward is his squire as well . . . but I do not care to wake every dawn \\nwondering if you\\'ve run off again. So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. \\nAre you a brother of the Night\\'s Watch . . . or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?\" \\nJon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath. Forgive me, Father. Robb, Arya, Bran ... \\nforgive me, I cannot help you. He has the truth of it. This is my place. \"I am . . . yours, my lord. Your \\nman. I swear it. I will not run again.\" \\nThe Old Bear snorted. \"Good. Now go put on your sword.\" \\nCATELYN \\nIt seemed a thousand years ago that Catelyn Stark had carried her infant son out of Riverrun, crossing \\nPage 548\\n\\nthe Tumblestone in a small boat to begin their journey north to Winterfell. And it was across the \\nTumblestone that they came home now, though the boy wore plate and mail in place of swaddling \\nclothes. \\nRobb sat in the bow with Grey Wind, his hand resting on his direwolf s head as the rowers pulled at their \\noars. Theon Greyjoy was with him. Her uncle Brynden would come behind in the second boat, with the \\nGreatjon and Lord Karstark. \\nCatelyn took a place toward the stern. They shot down the Tumblestone, letting the strong current push \\nthem past the looming Wheel Tower. The splash and rumble of the great waterwheel within was a sound \\nfrom her girlhood that brought a sad smile to Catelyn\\'s face. From the sandstone walls of the castle, \\nsoldiers and servants shouted down her name, and Robb\\'s, and \"Winterfell!\" From every rampart waved \\nthe banner of House Tully: a leaping trout, silver, against a rippling blue-and-red field. It was a stirring \\nsight, yet it did not lift her heart. She wondered if indeed her heart would ever lift again. Oh, Ned . . . \\nBelow the Wheel Tower, they made a wide turn and knifed through the churning water. The men put \\ntheir backs into it. The wide arch of the Water Gate came into view, and she heard the creak of heavy \\nchains as the great iron portcullis was winched upward. It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn \\nsaw that the lower half of it was red with rust. The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as they \\npassed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn gazed up at the bars and \\nwondered how deep the rust went and how well the portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it \\nought to be replaced. Thoughts like that were seldom far from her mind these days. \\nThey passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to shadow and back into \\nsunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, secured to iron rings set in the stone. Her \\nfather\\'s guards waited on the water stair with her brother. Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man \\nwith a shaggy head of auburn hair and a fiery beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from \\nbattle, his blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord `I~tos \\nBlackwood, a hard pike of a man with close-cropped saltand-pepper whiskers and a hook nose. His \\nbright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf patterns, and a cloak sewn from raven \\nfeathers draped his thin shoulders. It had been Lord `J~tos who led the sortie that plucked her brother \\nfrom the Lannister camp. \\n\"Bring them in,\" Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the stairs knee-deep in the water \\nPage 549\\n\\nand pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey Wind bounded out, one of them dropped his pole \\nand lurched back, stumbling and sitting down abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a \\nsheepish look on his face. Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn by the \\nwaist, setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots. \\nEdmure came down the steps to embrace her. \"Sweet sister,\" he murmured hoarsely. He had deep blue \\neyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not smiling now. He looked worn and tired, battered by \\nbattle and haggard from strain. His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged \\nhim fiercely. \\n\"Your grief is mine, Cat,\" he said when they broke apart. \"When we heard about Lord Eddard . . . the \\nLannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your vengeance.\" \\n\"Will that bring Ned back to me?\" she said sharply. The wound was still too fresh for softer words. She \\ncould not think about Ned now. She would not. It would not do. She had to be strong. \"All that will \\nkeep. I must see Father.\" \\n\"He awaits you in his solar,\" Edmure said. \\n\"Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,\" her father\\'s steward ex \\nplained. When had that good man grown so old and grey? \"He instructed me to bring you to him at \\nonce.\" \\n\"I\\'ll take her.\" Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower bailey, where Petyr Baelish \\nand Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her favor. The: massive sandstone walls of the keep \\nloomed above them. As they pushed through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she \\nasked, \"How bad is he?\" dreading the answer even as she said the words. \\nEdmure\\'s look was somber. \"He will not be with us long, the maesters say. The pain is . . . constant, and \\ngrievous.\" \\nPage 550\\n\\nA blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her sister Lysa, at the \\nLannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the monstrous gods who would take them both \\naway from her. \"You should have told me,\" she said. \"You should have sent word as soon as you knew.\" \\n\"He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With the realm so troubled, he \\nfeared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he was . . . 9\\' \\n\". . . they might attack?\" Catelyn finished, hard. It was your doing, yours, a voice whispered inside her. \\nIfyou had not taken it upon yourself to seize the dwarf . . . \\nThey climbed the spiral stair in silence. \\nThe keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster\\'s solar was triangular as well, with a \\nstone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of some great sandstone ship. From there the lord \\nof the castle could look down on his walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They \\nhad moved her father\\'s bed out onto the balcony. \"He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,\" Edmure \\nexplained. \"Father, see who I\\'ve brought. Cat has come to see you . . . \\nHoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as he grew older. Now he \\nseemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. Even his face sagged. The last time Catelyn \\nhad seen him, his hair and beard had been brown, well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as \\nsnow. \\nHis eyes opened to the sound of Edmure\\'s voice. \"Little cat,\" he murmured in a voice thin and wispy and \\nwracked by pain. \"My little cat.\" A tremulous smile touched his face as his hand groped for hers. \"I \\nwatched for you . . .\" \\n\"I shall leave you to talk,\" her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on the brow before he \\nwithdrew. \\nCatelyn knelt and took her father\\'s hand in hers. It was a big hand, \\nPage 551\\n\\nbut fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from it. \"You should \\nhave told me,\" she said. \"A rider, a raven . . .\" \\n\"Riders are taken, questioned,\" he answered. \"Ravens are brought down . . .\" A spasm of pain took him, \\nand his fingers clutched hers hard. \"The crabs are in my belly . . . pinching, always pinching. Day and \\nnight. They have fierce claws, the crabs. Maester Vyman makes me dreamwine, milk of the poppy . . . I \\nsleep a lot . . . but I wanted to be awake to see you, when you came. I was afraid . . . when the \\nLannisters took your brother, the camps all around us . . . was afraid I would go, before I could see you \\nagain . . . I was afraid . .\" \\n\"I\\'m here, Father,\" she said. \"With Robb, my son. He\\'ll want to see you too.\" \\n\"Your boy,\" he whispered. \"He had my eyes, I remember \\n\"He did, and does. And we\\'ve brought you Jaime Lannister, in irons. Riverrun is free again, Father.\" \\nLord Hoster smiled. \"I saw. Last night, when it began, I told them . . . had to see. They carried me to the \\ngatehouse . . . watched from the battlements. Ah, that was beautiful . . . the torches came in a wave, I \\ncould hear the cries floating across the river . .\\'. sweet cries . . . when that siege tower went up, gods . . . \\nwould have died then, and glad, if only I could have seen you children first. Was it your boy who did it? \\nWas it your Robb?\" \\n\"Yes,\" Catelyn said, fiercely proud. \"It was Robb . . . and Brynden. Your brother is here as well, my \\nlord.\" \\n\"Him.\" Her father\\'s voice was a faint whisper. \"The Blackfish . . . came back? From the Vale?\" \\n\"Yes.,, \\nPage 552\\n\\n\"And Lysa?\" A cool wind moved through his thin white hair. \"Gods be good, your sister . . . did she \\ncome as well?\" \\nHe sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth. \"No. I\\'m sorry . . .\" \\n\"Oh.\" His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes. \"I\\'d hoped I would have liked to see her, before \\n\"She\\'s with her son, in the Eyrie.\" \\nLord Hoster gave a weary nod. \"Lord Robert now, poor Arryn\\'s gone . . . I remember . . . why did she \\nnot come with you?\" \\n\"She is frightened, my lord. In the Eyrie she feels safe.\" She kissed his wrinkled brow. \"Robb will be \\nwaiting. Will you see him? And Brynden?\" \\n\"Your son,\" he whispered. \"Yes. Cat\\'s child . . . he had my eyes, I remember. When he was born. Bring \\nhim . . . yes.\" \\n\"And your brother?\" \\nHer father glanced out over the rivers. \"Blackfish,\" he said. \"Has he wed yet? Taken some . . . girl to \\nwife?\" \\nEven on his deathbed, Catelyn thought sadly. \"He has not wed. You know that, Father. Nor will he \\never.\" \\nPage 553\\n\\n\"I told him . . . commanded him. Marry! I was his lord. He knows. My right, to make his match. A good \\nmatch. A Redwyne. Old House. Sweet girl, pretty . . . freckles . . . Bethany, yes. Poor child. Still waiting. \\nYes. Still . . .\" \\n\"Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,\" Catelyn reminded him. \"She has three children by \\nhim.\" \\n\"Even so,\" Lord Hoster muttered. \"Even so. Spit on the girl. The Redwynes. Spit on me. His lord, his \\nbrother . . . that Blackfish. I had other offers. Lord Bracken\\'s girl. Walder Frey . . . any of three, he said . \\n. . Has he wed? Anyone? Anyone?\" \\n\"No one,\" Catelyn said, \"yet he has come many leagues to see you, fighting his way back to Riverrun. I \\nwould not be here now, if Ser Brynden had not helped us.\" \\n\"He was ever a warrior,\" her father husked. \"That he could do. Knight of the Gate, yes.\" He leaned back \\nand closed his eyes, inutterably weary. \"Send him. Later. I\\'ll sleep now. Too sick to fight. Send him up \\nlater, the Blackfish . . .\" \\nCatelyn kissed him gently, smoothed his hair, and left him there in the shade of his keep, with his rivers \\nflowing beneath. He was asleep before she left the solar. \\nWhen she returned to the lower bailey, Ser Brynden Tully stood on the water stairs with wet boots, \\ntalking with the captain of Riverrun\\'s guards. He came to her at once. \"Is he-T\\' \\n\"Dying,\" she said. \"As we feared.\" \\nHer uncle\\'s craggy face showed his pain plain. He ran his fingers through his thick grey hair. \"Will he see \\nme?\" \\nShe nodded. \"He says he is too sick to fight.\" \\nPage 554\\n\\nBrynden Blackfish chuckled. \"I am too old a soldier to believe that. Hoster will be chiding me about the \\nRedwyne girl even as we light his funeral pyre, damn his bones.\" \\nCatelyn smiled, knowing it was true. \"I do not see Robb.\" \\n\"He went with Greyjoy to the hall, I believe.\" \\nTheon Greyjoy was seated on a bench in Riverrun\\'s Great Hall, enjoying a horn of ale and regaling her \\nfather\\'s garrison with an account of the slaughter in the Whispering Wood. \"Some tried to flee, but we\\'d \\npinched the valley shut at both ends, and we rode out of the darkness with sword and lance. The \\nLannisters must have thought the \\nOthers themselves were on them when that wolf of Robb\\'s got in among them. I saw him tear one man\\'s \\narm from his shoulder, and their horses went mad at the scent of him. I couldn\\'t tell you how many men \\nwere thrown-\" \\n\"Theon,\" she interrupted, \"where might I find my son?\" \\n\"Lord Robb went to visit the godswood, MY lady.,, \\nIt was what Ned would have done. He is his father\\'s son as much as mine, I must remember. Oh, gods, \\nNed . . . \\nShe found Robb beneath the green canopy of leaves, surrounded by tall redwoods and great old elms, \\nkneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood with a face more sad than fierce. His longsword was \\nbefore him, the point thrust in the earth, his gloved hands clasped around the hilt. Around him others \\nknelt: Greatjon Umber, Rickard Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and more. Even Tytos \\nBlackwood was among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind him. These are the ones who keep \\nthe old gods, she realized. She asked herself what gods she kept these days, and could not find an \\nanswer. \\nPage 555\\n\\nIt would not do to disturb them at their prayers. The gods must have their due . . . even cruel gods who \\nwould take Ned from her, and her lord father as well. So Catelyn waited. The river wind moved through \\nthe high branches, and she could see the Wheel Tower to her right, ivy crawling up its side. As she stood \\nthere, all the memories came flooding back to her. Her father had taught her to ride amongst these trees, \\nand that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his arm, and over there, beneath that \\nbower, she and Lysa had played at kissing with Petyr. \\nShe had not thought of that in years. How young they all had been-she no older than Sansa, Lysa \\nyounger than Arya, and Petyr younger still, yet eager. The girls had traded him between them, serious \\nand giggling by turns. It came back to her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her \\nshoulders and taste the mint on his breath. There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr \\nhad liked to chew it. He had been such a bold little boy, always in trouble. \"He tried to put his tongue in \\nmy mouth,\" Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward, when they were alone. \"He did with me too,\" \\nLysa had whispered, shy and breathless. \"I liked it.\" \\nRobb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and Catelyn found herself wondering whether her \\nson had ever kissed a girl in the godswood. Surely he must have. She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him \\nmoist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones as old as eighteen . . . he had ridden in \\nbattle and killed men with a sword, \\nsurely he had been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She wiped them away angrily. \\n\"Mother,\" Robb said when he saw her standing there. \"We must call a council. There are things to be \\ndecided.\" \\n\"Your grandfather would like to see you,\" she said. \"Robb, he\\'s very sick.\" \\n\"Ser Edmure told me. I am sorry, Mother . . . for Lord Hoster and for you. Yet first we must meet. \\nWe\\'ve had word from the south. Renly Baratheon has claimed his brother\\'s crown.\" \\nPage 556\\n\\n\"Renly?\" she said, shocked. \"I had thought, surely it would be Lord Stannis . . .\" \\n\"So did we all, my lady,\" Galbart Glover said. \\nThe war council convened in the Great Hall, at four long trestle tables arranged in a broken square. Lord \\nHoster was too weak to attend, asleep on his balcony, dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth. \\nEdmure sat in the high seat of the Tullys, with Brynden Blackfish at his side, and his father\\'s bannermen \\narrayed to right and left and along the side tables. Word of the victory at Riverrun had spread to the \\nfugitive lords of the Trident, drawing them back. Karyl Vance came in, a lord now, his father dead \\nbeneath the Golden Tooth. Ser Marq Piper was with him, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun\\'s son, \\na lad no older than Bran. Lord Jonos Bracken arrived from the ruins of Stone Hedge, glowering and \\nblustering, and took a seat as far from Tytos Blackwood as the tables would permit. \\nThe northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother across the tables. They were \\nfewer. The Greatjon sat at Robb\\'s left hand, and then Theon Greyjoy; Galbart Glover and Lady \\nMormont were to the right of Catelyn. Lord Rickard Karstark, gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took \\nhis seat like a man in a nightmare, his long beard uncombed and unwashed. He had left two sons dead in \\nthe Whispering Wood, and there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led the Karstark spears \\nagainst Tywin Lannister on the Green Fork. \\nThe arguing raged on late into the night. Each lord had a right to speak, and speak they did . . . and \\nshout, and curse, and reason, and cajole, and jest, and bargain, and slam tankards on the table, and \\nthreaten, and walk out, and return sullen or smiling. Catelyn sat and listened to it all. \\nRoose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Ser \\nHelman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. Lord Tywin\\'s army had crossed the Trident, \\nand was making for Harrenhal. And there were two kings in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement. \\nMany of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end \\nLannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock \\ninstead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister \\npointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they \\nPage 557\\n\\nstrengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would have none of it. They \\nshould finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose \\nBolton\\'s army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken \\nrose to insist they ought pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his. \\n\"Renly is not the king,\" Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how \\nto listen. \\n\"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,\" Galbart Glover said. \"He put your father to death.\" \\n\"That makes him evil,\" Robb replied. \"I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert\\'s \\neldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean \\nto see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.\" \\n\"Tommen is no less a Lannister,\" Ser Marq Piper snapped. \\n\"As you say,\" said Robb, troubled. \"Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He\\'s \\nRobert\\'s younger brother. Bran can\\'t be Lord of Winterfell before me, and Renly can\\'t be king before \\nLord Stannis.\" \\nLady Mormont agreed. \"Lord Stannis has the better claim.\" \\n\"Renly is crowned,\" said Marq Piper. \"Highgarden and Storm\\'s End support his claim, and the \\nDornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of \\nthe seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, \\nwithin the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, \\nthe Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, all of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does \\nLord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?\" \\n\"The right,\" said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it. \\n\"So you mean us to declare for Stannis?\" asked Edmure. \\nPage 558\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Robb. \"I prayed to know what to do, but the \\ngods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if \\nJoffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we will be traitors.\" \\n\"My lord father would urge caution,\" aged Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly smile of a Frey. \"Wait, let \\nthese two kings play their game of thrones. When they are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the \\nvictor, or oppose him, as we choose. With Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce . . . \\nand the safe return of his son. Noble lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange good terms \\nand ransoms . . .\" \\nA roar of outrage drowned out his voice. \"Craven!\" the Greatjon thundered. \"Begging for a truce will \\nmake us seem weak,\" declared Lady Mormont. \"Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the \\nKingslayer,\" shouted Rickard Karstark. \\n\"Why not a peace?\" Catelyn asked. \\nThe lords looked at her, but it was Robb\\'s eyes she felt, his and his alone. \"My lady, they murdered my \\nlord father, your husband,\" he said grimly. He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before \\nhim, the bright steel on the rough wood. \"This is the only peace I have for Lannisters.\" \\nThe Greatjon bellowed his approval, and other men added their voices, shouting and drawing swords \\nand pounding their fists on the table. Catelyn waited until they had quieted. \"My lords,\" she said then, \\n\"Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared his bed and bore his children. Do you think I love him any less \\nthan you?\" Her voice almost broke with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself. \\n\"Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side \\nonce more . . . but he is gone, and hundred Whispering Woods will not change that. Ned is gone, and \\nDaryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark\\'s valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of \\nthem will return to us. Must we have more deaths still?\" \\n\"You are a woman, my lady,\" the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice. \"Women do not understand these \\nPage 559\\n\\nthings.\" \\n\"You are the gentle sex,\" said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. \"A man has a need \\nfor vengeance.\" \\n\"Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how gentle a woman can be,\" Catelyn \\nreplied. \"Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy . . . but I understand futility. We went to war \\nwhen Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands, and Ned was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. \\nWe fought to defend ourselves, and to win my lord\\'s freedom. \\n\"Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach. I will mourn for Ned until the end of my \\ndays, but I must think of the living. I want my daughters back, and the queen holds them still. If I must \\ntrade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you \\nsafe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father\\'s seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed \\na woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my \\nhusband.\" \\nThe hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking. \\n\"Peace,\" said her uncle Brynden. \"Peace is sweet, my lady . . . but on what terms? It is no good \\nhammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow.\" \\n\"What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but their bones?\" \\nasked Rickard Karstark. \\n\"Aye,\" said Lord Bracken. \"Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields, slaughtered my smallfolk, and left \\nStone Hedge a smoking ruin. Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him? What have we \\nfought for, if we are to put all back as it was before?\" \\nLord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn\\'s surprise and dismay. \"And if we do make peace with King \\nJoffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly? What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where \\nPage 560\\n\\nwould that leave us?\" \\n\"Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never call a Lannister my king,\" declared Marq Piper. \\n\"Nor P\" yelled the little Darry boy. \"I never will!\" \\nAgain the shouting began. Catelyn sat despairing. She had come so close, she thought. They had almost \\nlistened, almost . . . but the moment was gone. There would be no peace, no chance to heal, no safety. \\nShe looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to \\nhis war. He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain \\nbefore her now: the sword he had laid on the table. \\nCatelyn was thinking of her girls, wondering if she would ever see them again, when the Greatjon lurched \\nto his feet. \\n\"MYLORDS!\" he shouted, his voice booming off the rafters. \"Here is what I say to these two kings!\" He \\nspat. \" Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, \\nfrom some flowery seat in Highgarden or Dorne? What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or \\nthe barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I\\'ve had a \\nbellyful of them.\" He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. \\n\"Why shouldn\\'t we rule ourselves \\nagain? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!\" He pointed at Robb with the \\nblade. \"There sits the only king I mean to bow my knee to, m\\'lords,\" he thundered. \"The King in the \\nNorth!\" \\nAnd he knelt, and laid his sword at her son\\'s feet. \\n\"I\\'ll have peace on those terms,\" Lord Karstark said. \"They can keep their red castle and their iron chair \\nas well.\" He eased his longsword from its scabbard. \"The King in the North!\" he said, kneeling beside the \\nGreatjon. \\nPage 561\\n\\nMaege Mormont stood. \"The King of Winter!\" she declared, and laid her spiked mace beside the \\nswords. And the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had \\nnever been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades, bending their \\nknees and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred \\nyears, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdoms one . . . yet now were heard \\nagain, ringing from the timbers of her father\\'s hall: \\n\"The King in the North!\" \\n\"The King in the North!\" \\n\"THE KING IN THE NORTH!\" \\nDAFNERYS \\nThe land was red and dead and parched, and good wood was hard to come by. Her foragers returned \\nwith gnarled cottonwoods, purple brush, sheaves of brown grass. They took the two straightest trees, \\nhacked the limbs and branches from them, skinned off their bark, and split them, laying the logs in a \\nsquare. Its center they filled with straw, brush, bark shavings, and bundles of dry grass. Rakharo chose a \\nstallion from the small herd that remained to them; he was not the equal of Khal Drogo\\'s red, but few \\nhorses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant \\nwith an axe blow between the eyes. \\nBound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes. \"It is not \\nenough to kill a horse,\" she told Dany. \"By itself, the blood is nothing. You do not have the words to \\nmake a spell, nor the wisdom to find them. Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children? You call me \\nmaegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You are a child, with a child\\'s ignorance. Whatever \\nyou mean to do, it will not work. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you.\" \\n\"I am tired of the maegi\\'s braying,\" Dany told Jhogo. He took his whip to her, and after that the godswife \\nkept silent. \\nPage 562\\n\\nOver the carcass of the horse, they built a platform of hewn logs; trunks of smaller trees and limbs from \\nthe greater, and the thickest \\nI \\n9 \\nstraightest branches they could find. They laid the wood east to west, from sunrise to sunset. On the \\nplatform they piled Khal Drogo\\'s treasures: his great tent, his painted vests, his saddles and harness, the \\nwhip his father had given him when he came to manhood, the arakh he had used to slay Khal Ogo and \\nhis son, a mighty dragonbone bow. Aggo would have added the weapons Drogo\\'s bloodriders had given \\nDany for bride gifts as well, but she forbade it. \"Those are mine,\" she told him, \"and I mean to keep \\nthem.\" Another layer of brush was piled about the khal\\'s treasures, and bundles of dried grass scattered \\nover them. \\nSer Jorah Mormont drew her aside as the sun was creeping toward its zenith. \"Princess . . .\" he began. \\n\"Why do you call me that?\" Dany challenged him. \"My brother Viserys was your king, was he not?\" \\n\"He was, my lady.\" \\n\"Viserys is dead. I am his heir, the last blood of House Targaryen. Whatever was his is mine now.\" \\n\"My . . . queen,\" Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. \"My sword that was his is yours, Dacnerys. And my \\nheart as well, that never belonged to your brother. I am only a knight, and I have nothing to offer you but \\nexile, but I beg you, hear me. Let Khal Drogo go. You shall not be alone. I promise you, no man shall \\ntake you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go. You need not join the dosh khaleen. Come east with \\nme. Yi Ti, Oarth, the Jade Sea, Asshai by the Shadow. We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and \\ndrink what wines the gods see fit to serve us. Please, Khaleesi. I know what you intend. Do not. Do not.\" \\n\"I must,\" Dany told him. She touched his face, fondly, sadly. \"You do not understand.\" \\nPage 563\\n\\nA understand that you loved him,\" Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. \"I loved my lady wife \\nonce, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside \\nas you climb on Drogo\\'s pyre. I will not watch you burn.\" \\n\"Is that what you fear?\" Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead. \"I am not such a child as that, \\nsweet ser.\" \\n\"You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?\" \\nA swear it,\" she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers. \\nThe third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a finger, and covered with dry \\nleaves and twigs. They laid them north to south, from ice to fire, and piled them high with soft cushions \\nand sleeping silks. The sun had begun to lower toward the west by the \\ntime they were done. Dany called the Dothraki around her. Fewer than a hundred were left. How many \\nhad Aegon started with? she wondered. It did not matter. \\n\"You will be my khalasar,\" she told them. \"I see the faces of slaves. I free you. Take off your collars. Go \\nif you wish, no one shall harm you. If you stay, it will be as brothers and sisters, husbands and wives.\" \\nThe black eyes watched her, wary, expressionless. \"I see the children, women, the wrinkled faces of the \\naged. I was a child yesterday. Today I am a woman. Tomorrow I will be old. To each of you I say, give \\nme your hands and your hearts, and there will always be a place for you.\" She turned to the three young \\nwarriors of her khas. \"Jhogo, to you I give the silver-handled whip that was my bride gift, and name you \\nko, and ask your oath, that you will live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe \\nfrom harm.\" \\nJhogo took the whip from her hands, but his face was confused. \"Khaleesi, \" he said hesitantly, \"this is \\nnot done. It would shame me, to be bloodrider to a woman.\" \\nPage 564\\n\\n\"Aggo,\" Dany called, paying no heed to Jhogo\\'s words. If I look back I am lost. \"To you I give the \\ndragonbone bow that was my bride gift.\" It was double-curved, shiny black and exquisite, taller than she \\nwas. \"I name you ko, and ask your oath, that you should live and die as blood of my blood, riding at my \\nside to keep me safe from harm.\" \\nAggo accepted the bow with lowered eyes. \"I cannot say these words. Only a man can lead a khalasar \\nor name a ko.\" \\n\"Rakharo,\" Dany said, turning away from the refusal, \"you shall have the great arakh that was my bride \\ngift, with hilt and blade chased in gold. And you too I name my ko, and ask that you live and die as blood \\nof my blood, riding at my side to keep me safe from harm.\" \\n\"You are khaleesi,\" Rakharo said, taking the arakh. \"I shall ride at your side to Vaes Dothrak beneath \\nthe Mother of Mountains, and keep you safe from harm until you take your place with the crones of the \\ndosh khaleen. No more can I promise.\" \\nShe nodded, as calmly as if she had not heard his answer, and turned to the last of her champions. \"Ser \\nJorah Mormont,\" she said, \"first and greatest of my knights, I have no bride gift to give you, but I swear \\nto you, one day you shall have from my hands a longsword like none the world has ever seen, \\ndragon-forged and made of Valyrian steel. And I would ask for your oath as well.\" \\n\"You have it, my queen,\" Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay his sword at her feet. \"I vow to serve you, to \\nobey you, to die for you if need be.\" \\n\"Whatever may come?\" \\n\"Whatever may come.\" \\n\"I shall hold you to that oath. I pray you never regret the giving of it.\" Dany lifted him to his feet. \\nPage 565\\n\\nStretching on her toes to reach his lips, she kissed the knight gently and said, \"You are the first of my \\nQueensguard.\" \\nShe could feel the eyes of the khalasar on her as she entered her tent. The Dothraki were muttering and \\ngiving her strange sideways looks from the corners of their dark almond eyes. They thought her mad, \\nDany realized. Perhaps she was. She would know soon enough. If I look back I am lost. \\nHer bath was scalding hot when Irri helped her into the tub, but Dany did not flinch or cry aloud. She \\nliked the heat. It made her feel clean. Jhiqui had scented the water with the oils she had found in the \\nmarket in Vaes Dothrak; the steam rose moist and fragrant. Doreah washed her hair and combed it out, \\nworking loose the mats and tangles. Irri scrubbed her back. Dany closed her eyes and let the smell and \\nthe warmth enfold her. She could feel the heat soaking through the soreness between her thighs. She \\nshuddered when it entered her, and her pain and stiffness seemed to dissolve. She floated. \\nWhen she was clean, her handmaids helped her from the water. Irri and Jhiqui fanned her dry, while \\nDoreah brushed her hair until it fell like a river of liquid silver down her back. They scented her with \\nspiceflower and cinnamon; a touch on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. \\nThe last dab was for her sex. Irri\\'s finger felt as light and cool as a lover\\'s kiss as it slid softly up between \\nher lips. \\nAfterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his final ride into the night \\nlands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his hair, running her fingers through it for the last \\ntime, feeling the weight of it, remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride. \\nHis hair had never been cut. How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried her face in it and \\ninhaled the dark fragrance of the oils. He smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and semen and \\nhorses. He smelled like Drogo. Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought. Forgive me for all I have done \\nand all I must do. I paid the price, my star, but it was too high, too high . . . \\nDany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his bells one by one. So many \\nbells, gold and silver and bronze. Bells so his enemies would hear him coming and grow weak with fear. \\nShe dressed him in horsehair leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver \\nmedallions about his waist. Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the one \\nDrogo had \\nloved best. For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that laced halfway up her legs, and a \\nPage 566\\n\\nvest like Drogo\\'s. \\nThe sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre. The Dothraki \\nwatched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent. Dany walked behind them. They laid him \\ndown on his cushions and silks, his head toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast. \\n\"Oil,\" she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over the pyre, soaking the silks \\nand the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich \\nwith fragrance. \"Bring my eggs,\" Dany commanded her handmaids. Something in her voice made them \\nrun. \\nSer Jorah took her arm. \"My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon\\'s eggs in the night lands. Better \\nto sell them in Asshai. Sell one and we can buy a ship to take us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three \\nand you will be a wealthy woman all your days.\" \\n\"They were not given to me to sell,\" Dany told him. \\nShe climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-andstars. The black beside his heart, \\nunder his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled around it. The cream-and-gold down between \\nhis legs. When she kissed him for the last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips. \\nAs she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. \"You are mad,\" the \\ngodswife said hoarsely. \\n\"Is it so far from madness to wisdom?\" Dany asked. \"Ser Jorah, take this maegi and bind her to the \\npyre.\" \\n\"To the . . . my queen, no, hear me . . .\" \\n\"Do as I say.\" Still he hesitated, until her anger flared. \"You swore to obey me, whatever might come. \\nRakharo, help him.\" \\nPage 567\\n\\nThe godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo\\'s pyre and staked her down amidst his \\ntreasures. Dany poured the oil over the woman\\'s head herself. \"I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,\" she said, \\n\"for the lessons you have taught me.\" \\n\"You will not hear me scream,\" Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her hair and soaked her \\nclothing. \\n\"I will,\" Dany said, \"but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I remember what you told me. Only \\ndeath can pay for life.\" Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, \\nDany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi\\'s flat black eyes; in its place was something that \\nmight have been fear. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star. \\nWhen a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride \\nA GAME, OF THRONLS 703 \\nproud into the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the khal rises on his fiery \\nsteed to take his place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned in life, the brighter his star will \\nshine in the darkness. \\nJhogo spied it first. \"There, \" he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw it, low in the east. The first \\nstar was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the dragon\\'s tail. She could not have asked for a \\nstronger sign. \\nDany took the torch from Aggo\\'s hand and thrust it between the logs. The oil took the fire at once, the \\nbrush and dried grass a heartbeat later. Tiny flames went darting up the wood like swift red mice, skating \\nover the oil and leaping from bark to branch to leaf. A rising heat puffed at her face, soft and sudden as a \\nlover\\'s breath, but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear. Dany stepped backward. The wood \\ncrackled, louder and louder. Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill, ululating voice. The flames whirled \\nand writhed, racing each other up the platform. The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy \\nfrom the heat. Dany heard logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew \\nlouder, shriller . . . then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering wail, thin and \\nhigh and full of agony. \\nPage 568\\n\\nAnd now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. His clothing took fire, and \\nfor an instant the khal was clad in wisps of floating orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and \\ngreasy. Dany\\'s lips parted and she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as \\nSer Jorah had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her one last \\ntime, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, forever. \\nShe could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh roasting in a firepit. The pyre \\nroared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur\\'s \\nscreaming and sending up long tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew \\nthicker, the Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners in that \\nhellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the smoke to float away into the dark \\nlike so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, \\ndriving off even Mormont, but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was \\nin her. \\nShe had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer to the conflagration, but \\nthe brazier had not been hot \\nenough. The flames writhed before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and \\nsinging and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet lovely, so lovely, \\nalive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed and glowing. This is a wedding, too, she \\nthought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and \\nchildren learn. \\nAnother step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, even through her sandals. \\nSweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had \\nonce run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. The \\nflames were so beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen, each one a sorcerer robed in yellow and \\norange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and great yellow serpents and \\nunicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes and monsters, wolves and bright birds and \\nflowering trees, each more beautiful than the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, \\nits flowing mane a nimbus of blue flame. Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, tide now. \\nHer vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the ground. The painted leather \\nburst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk \\nflowing from her red and swollen nipples. Now, she thought, now, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal \\nDrogo before her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the whip \\nPage 569\\n\\nsnaked down at the pyre, hissing. \\nShe heard a crack, the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and brush and grass began to \\nshift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid down at her, and Dany was showered with ash \\nand cinders. And something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk \\nof curved rock, pale and veined with gold, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly \\nthrough the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder. \\nOnly death can pay for life. \\nAnd there came a second crack, loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke stirred and whirled around \\nher and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams \\nof frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah \\ncalling her name and cursing. No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear.for me. \\nThe fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of \\ndragons, mother of dragons, don\\'t you see? Don\\'t you SEE? With a belch of flame and smoke that \\nreached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down around her. Unafraid, Dany stepped \\nforward into the firestorm, calling to her children. \\nThe third crack was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world. \\nWhen the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, Ser Jorah Mormont found \\nher amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of \\nman and woman and stallion. She was naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful \\nhair all crisped away . . . yet she was unhurt. \\nThe cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-bronze at the right. Her arms \\ncradled them close. The black-and-scarlet beast was draped across her shoulders, its long sinuous neck \\ncoiled under her chin. When it saw Jorah, it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals. \\nPage 570\\n\\nWordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her khas came up behind him. Jhogo was the first to \\nlay his arakh at her feet. \"Blood of my blood,\" he murmured, pushing his face to the smoking earth. \\n\"Blood of my blood,\" she heard Aggo echo. \"Blood of my blood,\" Rakharo shouted. \\nAnd after them came her handmaids, and then the others, all the Dothraki, men and women and children, \\nand Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that they were hers now, today and tomorrow and \\nforever, hers as they had never been Drogo\\'s. \\nAs Daenerys Targaryen rose to her feet, her black hissed, pale smoke venting from its mouth and \\nnostrils. The other two pulled away from her breasts and added their voices to the call, translucent wings \\nunfolding and stirring the air, and for the first time in hundreds of years, the night came alive with the \\nmusic of dragons. \\nPage 571\\n\\n'"
